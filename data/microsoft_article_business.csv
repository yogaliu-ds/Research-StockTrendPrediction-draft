Union members are poised to reject Disney World contract offer,"Jan 30, 2023","Jonathan Pulliam has been working at Disney World since 2018, dressing up as everything from beloved Disney cartoon characters to Star Wars villains. And while he loves his job, he says he can't afford it any longer. ""Me loving it, that's not enough to pay the bills,"" he said about his $15.85-an-hour salary that usually earns him about $550 a week. With rent for a typical apartment in the Orlando area costing about $1,800 per month according to Realtor.com, he says he couldn't get by if he wasn't living with his sister. ""I'd probably be living in my car. I know several who are living in cars because they can't afford to pay rent,"" said the Kansas native, who remembers annual childhood trips to Disney World with his family. ""It's a tourist area. Everything's expensive."" On Thursday and Friday, about 32,000 Disney employees will be voting on a contract offer from management. These workers do everything from performing as characters to working in restaurants and shops, driving buses, trams and monorails as well as working at front desks and performing housekeeping duties at hotels. Those working under this contract, all of them full-time employees, represent more than 40% of all workers at Disney World. Currently, the park has 75,000 cast members, as the company refers to its employees, including full-time and part-time, hourly and salaried staff. It is comparable to Disney World's pre-pandemic employment levels. The company's five-year offer would raise salaries for cast members by a minimum of $1 an hour per year, taking most workers to at least $20 an hour by 2026. That would be $5 an hour more than the Florida minimum wage, which is in the process of being increased from the current $11 an hour to $15 an hour by 2026. The company said 46% of cast members will get more than a $1-an-hour raise in the contract's first year. This is a ""very strong offer"" with guaranteed raises each year of the five-year agreement, said Andrea Finger, a Disney spokesperson. She said the majority of employees will see raises totaling 33% to 46% during the life of the contract. The company's offer would pay housekeepers and bus drivers at least $20 an hour immediately and culinary staff would start at $20 to $25 per hour, depending on their role. There will also be retroactive pay increases dating back to October 1, when the previous contract expired, providing lump-sum pre-tax payments of about $700 to full-time workers. But union leadership is urging members to vote no. The unions say Disney presented this as its best offer and that is why it's going to membership for a vote -- not because there is a tentative agreement, which is the point at which an offer normally goes to rank-and-file union members for a vote. And this time around, all indications are that the company's offer will be rejected. The six union locals working under the current contract want an immediate $3 an hour raise, or a 20% raise, for what it says is 75% of the members currently making $15 an hour, plus an additional $1 an hour raise every year after that. ""The unions have been clear from our very first bargaining session that a dollar in the first year is not enough,"" said Matt Hollis, president of the Service Trades Council Union, the collection of six union locals that are negotiating with Disney management. ""A dollar does not afford Disney workers with the ability to keep up with the skyrocketing rent increases. And a dollar does not afford Disney workers with the ability to continue to purchase basic necessities, such as food, gas and utilities."" Pulliam, the character performer who says he can't afford a dollar-an-hour raise, lives about an hour's drive from the theme park, and says he'll be voting no because he can't get by with the wages being offered. ""I'm filling my car three times a week,"" he said. ""I would love to ask these execs if they could get by on $1 an hour more. It's disheartening. They don't have to decide [whether]...to eat or get gas."" Pulliam said he's angered by recent news reports about fired former Disney executives who left the company with huge pay packages, such as ex-Disney CEO Bob Chapek, who received a $20 million severance package when he was fired by the board in November, or Geoff Morrell, who received $10.3 million for his three months overseeing corporate and public affairs, or more than $100,000 a day. Negotiations on a new union contract have been ongoing since August. Despite widespread expectations that unions' rank-and-file will reject this offer, no strike deadline or strike authorization vote has been scheduled. Union leadership said they hope that Disney will return to the table with a better offer once union members reject this one. Disney doesn't rule out further negotiations, saying that after no votes on contracts there typically are additional rounds of talks. ""While Disney insists at the bargaining table that this is the best offer, we know Disney can do better, and Disney knows they must do better,"" said Hollis. He said the workers who would get more than a $1 an hour pay increase are in jobs where Disney is having trouble filling openings and retaining workers. Unions have represented workers at Disney World since soon after the park's 1971 opening, but employees have never gone on strike. Disney reported that its parks, experiences and products unit, which includes Disney World and other park locations worldwide, had revenue of $7.4 billion and operating income of $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2022, which ran through October 1. (The first six months of that fiscal year were affected by surging Covid cases.) Revenue was up 36% and profits more than doubled from the previous fiscal year. And both revenue and operating profits are above what the company posted in fiscal year 2019, before the pandemic, with a 12% rise in revenue and a 10% gain in earnings."
Chevron earnings soar to a record,"Jan 27, 2023","Chevron reported a record full-year profit of $36.5 billion, buoyed by high oil prices. Adjusted earnings for the year more than doubled from the $15.6 billion Chevron earned in 2021 and up 36% from its previous record profit set in 2011. The oil company's fourth-quarter earnings came in at $7.9 billion, up 61% from a year earlier but less than the record quarterly income of $11.4 billion it reported for the second quarter. The fourth quarter earnings per share of $4.09 fell short of the forecast of $4.38 a share from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. But revenue in the quarter of $56.5 billion topped forecasts by nearly $2 billion and was up 17% from a year earlier. Full-year revenue of $246.3 billion was up 52% from 2021. Shares of Chevron were down slightly more than 1% in premarket trading. Ahead of Friday's report Chevron, the nation's second largest oil company, behind only ExxonMobil, had announced it was hiking its dividend by 6% along with a massive $75 billion share repurchase plan. The decision brought criticism from those who said oil companies should be investing their money in producing more oil and gasoline to increase supply and drive down prices for inflation-weary drivers. ""For a company that claimed not too long ago that it was 'working hard' to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,"" said Abdullah Hasan, assistant press secretary at the White House, in a tweet Wednesday evening after the share repurchase was announced. Chevron said Friday its investments in operations increased by more than 75% from 2021, and annual US production increased to the equivalent of 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. The amount it spent on capital spending and exploration in 2022 was $12.3 billion, up 43% compared with $8.6 billion spent in 2021, but only slightly more than the $11 billion it spent on dividends or the $11.3 billion on share repurchases during the year. The record profit came primarily from the soaring oil prices during the year, not its increased production. Chevron and other major oil companies all benefited from the spike in oil and gasoline prices during 2022, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While Russia, one of the world's leading oil exporters, sent relatively little oil to the United States, sanctions placed on Russia following the invasion roiled global commodity prices which set the price of oil. Futures for a barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, hit a record of $123.58 close in early June, up more than 50% from six months earlier ahead of the war, and the average price of a gallon of regular gas in the United States broke the $5 mark a week later to reach a record $5.03. But oil and gas prices have fallen substantially since then. Brent closed Thursday at $87.47, slightly below the year-earlier level, while the average price of a gallon of regular gas stands at $3.51 a gallon, only slightly higher from the $3.35 average of a year ago. But prices have started to rise once again, partly because Covid lockdown rules in China have been lifted. Traders believe that's a bullish sign for global demand for oil and gasoline. Refinery problems caused by winter weather are also pushing prices higher. The average US price of a gallon of regular gasoline is up nearly 12 cents in just the last week and up 41 cents, or 13%, in the last month. Brent oil is up 12% in the last three weeks."
Jobs report to give further clues about where economy is headed,"Jan 29, 2023","The Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates again on Wednesday. But will it be another half-point hike or just a quarter-point increase? And what about the rest of the year? The Fed's actions beyond this week's meeting will depend primarily on whether inflation is truly slowing. Investors will get another clue when the January jobs report is released on Friday. Economists predict that 185,000 jobs were added last month, a slowdown from the gain of 223,000 jobs in December and 263,000 in November. A further deceleration in the labor market would likely please the Fed, as it would show that last year's rate hikes are successfully taking some air out of the economy. The Fed knows it's in a tough situation. Inflation pressures are partly fueled by wage gains for workers. In an environment where the unemployment rate is at a half-century low of 3.5%, employees have been able to command big increases in pay to keep up with rising prices of consumer goods and services. Along those lines, average hourly earnings, a measure of wages that is also part of the monthly jobs report, are expected to increase 4.3% year-over year. That's down from 4.6% in December and 5.1% in November. As wage growth cools, so do price increases. The Fed's favorite measure of inflation -- the Personal Consumption Price Index or PCE -- rose ""just"" 5% over the past 12 months through last December, compared to a 5.5% annual increase in November. That is still uncomfortably high, but the trend is moving in the right direction. The problem for the Fed, though, is that it may need to keep raising interest rates until there is further evidence that the labor market is cooling off enough to push the rate of inflation even lower. Recession or soft landing? Several other job market indicators continue to show that the US economy is in no serious danger of a recession just yet. The number of people filing for weekly jobless claims dipped last week to 186,000, a nine-month low. Investors will get the latest weekly initial claims numbers on Thursday. The market will also be closely watching reports about private-sector job growth from payroll processor ADP and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) from the Department of Labor this week. The last JOLTS report showed that more jobs were available than expected in November. Still, some expect that wage growth should continue to fall, which should take pressure off the Fed somewhat. ""Wage growth has been on a slowing trajectory, and we suspect that softer wage growth will be a trend in 2023 as jobs available contract,"" said Tony Welch, chief investment officer at SignatureFD, a wealth management firm, in a report. Not everyone agrees with that assessment. Organized labor has been winning bigger pay increases lately in the transportation industry. And more workers at tech and retail giants have been unionizing as of late. ""Workers will be loath to relinquish the bargaining power they perceive to have gained over the past year,"" said Jason Vaillancourt, global macro strategist at Putnam, in a report. Vaillancourt also pointed out that many consumers are still flush with cash that they saved up during the early stages of the pandemic. That could mean that inflation isn't going away anytime soon. And even though the pace of jobs gains may be slowing, it's not as if economists are starting to predict monthly job losses like the US has had in previous recessions. ""Combine a strong labor market with a still substantial reserve of excess savings, and you have all the components in place to keep the Fed up at night,"" Vaillancourt said. So as long as hopes for an economic ""soft landing"" persist, the Fed will have to keep worrying that inflation is too high. That increases the chances the Fed could go too far with rate hikes and ultimately lead to a recession. Techs on a tear Wall Street is clearly buying into the ""soft landing"" argument. Just look at how well tech stocks have done so far this year, despite a series of high-profile layoff announcements from top Silicon Valley companies in the past few months. The Nasdaq is up 11% so far in January, putting it on track for its best monthly performance since July. Some argue that more tech layoffs won't be a problem. Investors seem to be (somewhat perversely) taking the view that companies cutting costs is a good thing for profits and that revenue likely won't be impacted in a negative way because consumers are still spending. ""A theme that can't go unnoticed this month is how traders are rewarding firms for cutting jobs. With corporate layoffs making headlines each evening, you might think the consumer is strained. Maybe not so much. It turns out that demand is decent,"" said Frank Newman, portfolio manager at Ally Invest, in a report. But a continuation of the Nasdaq's surge may depend a lot on how well a quartet of tech leaders do when they report fourth quarter earnings next week: Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Amazon. ""A set of much weaker-than-expected reports from these firms could dent the market's strong start to 2023,"" said Daniel Berkowitz, senior investment officer for investment manager Prudent Management Associates, in a report. So far, tech earnings season is not off to an inspiring start, with Microsoft, Intel and IBM all reporting weak results. But it's important to note that that trio is part of the ""old tech"" guard while Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta all have more rapidly growing businesses. Tesla reported strong results last week, which could be a sign of good things to come from other more dynamic tech companies.

Wall Street is ignoring the Fed. That could be dangerous,"Jan 27, 2023","As the Federal Reserve continues its inflation-fighting tightrope act, market moves suggest that investors may be feeling more at ease with the central bank's actions. That's not necessarily a good thing. What's happening: The Fed is widely expected to reduce the pace at which it is hiking rates to a quarter of a percentage point in its upcoming meeting in February, following a similar deceleration in December when it hiked by half a point instead of three-quarters. The Fed has eased last year's historically high interest rate increases and recent data suggests that the chances of a ""soft landing"" for the US economy have improved. Price increases are also moderating: December brought the sixth consecutive monthly fall in consumer price index (CPI) inflation to 6.5%. This all means that investors are beginning to worry less about the Fed. To put it simply: Wall Street has bigger fish to fry. In the past few weeks, market reactions to speeches by Federal Reserve governors and new inflation data have gotten smaller while reactions to fourth-quarter corporate earnings announcements have gotten larger, according to Savita Subramanian, a quantitative strategist at Bank of America, in a recent analysis. That's a change from 2022 when the Fed and the market tended to move in unison. Investors have a serious fear of uncertainty, but they're sleeping well ahead of next week's Fed policy decision — they're about 98% sure that the central bank will announce a quarter-point hike, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Not so fast: There are still plenty of reasons for the Fed to remain hawkish. Labor markets remain strong, with the unemployment rate dropping to a post-pandemic low of 3.5%, and wage growth also remains high. Policymakers also seem to expect that the robust labor market will persist for some time. Even as inflation slows, a look under the hood of the latest report suggests that price increases may be higher and more persistent than the market hopes. Services inflation continues to run hot. Shelter inflation, a measure of housing costs and the CPI's largest component, just marked its strongest annualized rate (7.5%) since the 1980s. Investors are misreading the outlook for inflation, just as they did in July 2022, argues Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy for the Americas at Blackrock. ""We've seen this movie before,"" she wrote in a recent note. Fed funds futures now imply that the central bank will end its tightening streak by June and predict that it will ease interest rates by half a percentage point by the end of the year. But that outcome is at odds with the Fed's own verbal guidance and with its summary of economic projections. ""We do not expect the Fed to ease this year, even as growth slows, making it likely that we will see a recession in the U.S. in the second half of 2023,"" said Chaudhuri. This could mean that the upcoming Fed meeting will generate a lot of market disappointment, said Christian Scherrmann, an economist at DWS Group. The Fed flagged investors' persistent belief in a pivot away from elevated rates as something that could hurt efforts to restore price stability. Officials have also pointed to the growing gap between its projections and market pricing as a problem. What it means: ""The Fed foresees a soft landing, with an increasing risk of a mild recession, enabling it to keep rates higher for longer,"" said Scherrmann. ""On the other side, markets are pricing in a more severe economic downturn, forcing the Fed to bring down rates quickly."" There appear to be two conflicting views on the table for how the economy will evolve; next week's Fed meeting may help bring them together or tear them further apart. Bed Bath & Beyond can no longer pay its debts Bed Bath & Beyond coupons never expire, but you still better use them quickly. That's because the end could be near for the long-struggling retailer, report my colleagues Paul R. La Monica and Nathaniel Meyersohn. Bed Bath & Beyond warned in a regulatory filing Thursday that it received a notice of default from its lender, JPMorgan Chase. Shares of the company plunged more than 20% on the news, to about $2.56 a share. The company said in its SEC filing Thursday that ""at this time, the Company does not have sufficient resources to repay the amounts under the Credit Facilities and this will lead the Company to consider all strategic alternatives, including restructuring its debt under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code."" Bed Bath & Beyond defaulted ""on or around"" January 13, according to the Securities & Exchange Commission filing. As a result, creditors are demanding immediate payment and Bed Bath & Beyond could be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization due to its financial woes. Google's long period of online dominance could end This week, the US Justice Department accused Google of running an illegal monopoly in its online advertising business and called for parts of it to be broken up, reports my colleague Brian Fung. Google said the Justice Department is ""doubling down on a flawed argument"" and that the latest suit ""attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector."" If successful, however, the blockbuster case could upend a business model that's made Google the most powerful advertising company on the internet. It would be the most consequential antitrust victory against a tech giant since the US government took on Microsoft more than 20 years ago. But even though the lawsuit drives at the heart of Google's revenue machine, it could take years to play out. In the meantime, two other thorny issues are poised to determine Google's future on a potentially shorter timeframe: The rise of generative artificial intelligence and what appears to be an accelerating decline in Google's online ad marketshare. Just days before the DOJ suit, Google announced plans to cut 12,000 employees amid a dramatic slowdown in its revenue growth, and as it works to refocus its efforts partly around AI. As Brian writes: ""For the better part of 15 years, Google has seemed like an unstoppable force, powered by the strength of its online search engine and digital advertising business. But both now look increasingly vulnerable."" Nothing lasts forever."
"Prices rose at a slower pace last month, the Fed's favored inflation gauge shows","Jan 28, 2023","The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed prices rose at a slower pace last month, indicating further progress in the central bank's battle with higher prices. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, or PCE, rose by 5% in December, compared to a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported Friday. In December alone, prices rose 0.1% from November. On a month-to-month basis, prices for goods decreased 0.7% and prices for services increased 0.5%, according to the PCE price index for December. Within those categories, food prices increased 0.2% and energy prices decreased 5.1%. Core PCE, which doesn't include the more volatile food and energy categories, increased by 4.4% annually, down from November's annual rate of 4.7%. On a monthly basis, it was up 0.3%. Core PCE, which is now at its lowest level since October 2021, is the Fed's favored inflation gauge as it provides a more complete picture of consumer costs and spending. ""It's clear, continued progress on the inflation front — which is something we expected, but good to see,"" Joe Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist, told CNN. ""I think you're seeing continued softening across the entire report."" The data showed that consumers pulled back in December, with spending falling by 0.2% from the month before. Personal income rose 0.2% last month, the smallest increase since April. Through much of 2022, consumer spending remained robust in spite of high inflation, rising interest rates, and simmering recession fears. However, as the months dragged on, economic data suggested that consumers were running out of dry powder: Reliance on credit grew and delinquencies started to tick up, while savings levels declined. Retail sales fell 1.1% in December, the Commerce Department reported earlier this month. In Friday's report, the personal saving rate as a percentage of disposable income increased to 3.4% from 2.9% in November. The savings rate is now up 1 percentage point from its September low. The increase is ""a sign that consumers are growing cautious after rapidly drawing down their savings last year,"" Lydia Boussour, senior economist for EY Parthenon, said in a statement. Separately on Friday, a closely watched measurement of consumer attitudes toward the economy showed increased confidence in January for the second consecutive month. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index landed at 64.9 for January, up nearly 9% from December. Despite the uptick, the director of the school's Surveys of Consumers cautioned that there are ""considerable downside risks"" to sentiment and that two-thirds of consumers surveyed said they expect an economic downturn to occur in the next year. Massud Ghaussy, senior analyst of Nasdaq IR Intelligence, said consumer sentiment hinges heavily on the labor market. ""The big question this year so far is, 'is the jobs market the next shoe to fall?'"" he told CNN. ""The economic picture is still quite murky, and the reason why we're seeing consumer confidence still relatively strong is because of a strong job market."" Friday's PCE report is the last key inflation data before the Federal Reserve meets next week for its first policymaking meeting of 2023. Economists and investors are expecting the Fed to raise its benchmark rate by just quarter of a point, signaling another downshift following a spree of blockbuster rate hikes last year. The Fed is not expected to pivot simply because inflation is cooling, Davis said, noting that PCE isn't yet at the Fed's 2% target. The labor market, which has remained strong and tight despite inflation and interest rate hikes, remains a crucial area of focus in the Fed's inflation fight. The latest data on employment turnover as well as job growth will be released next week. ""The labor market is clearly Exhibit A in this debate between a soft landing or a mild recession,"" Davis said. ""The bigger wild card is, do the modest layoffs that we're seeing in the technology sector in particular spread to other parts of the economy?"""
Real estate agents say they can't imagine working without ChatGPT now,"Jan 29, 2023","If you came across a four bedroom, 3.5 bathroom home listed for sale recently on a quiet cul-de-sac in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, you might not think twice about the online listing. It included typical real estate descriptions like ""ideal for entertaining"" and ""ample space for relaxation."" But JJ Johannes, the realtor for the home, created the description in less than five seconds by typing a few keywords into ChatGPT, a viral new AI chatbot tool that can generate elaborate responses to user prompts. It's a task, he said, that would otherwise have taken him an hour or more to write on his own. ""It saved me so much time,"" Johannes told CNN, noting he made a few tweaks and edits to ChatGPT's work before publishing it. ""It's not perfect but it was a great starting point. My background is in technology and writing something eloquent takes time. This made it so much easier."" Johannes is among the real estate agents experimenting with ChatGPT since it was released publicly in late November. Some residential and commercial agents told CNN it has already changed the way they work, from writing listings and social media posts to drafting legal documents. It could also be used to automate repetitive tasks such as answering frequently asked questions and doing complex calculations. ChatGPT is trained on vast amounts of online data in order to generate responses to user prompts. It has written original essays, stories, song lyrics and research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists. Some CEOs have used it to write emails or do accounting work. It even passed an exam at an Ivy League school. (It has, however, raised concerns among some for its potential to enable cheating and for its inaccuracies.) In less than two months, ChatGPT has sparked discussions around its potential to disrupt various industries, from publishing to law. But it's already having a tangible impact on how a number of real estate agents around the country do their jobs -- where much of the written work can be formulaic and time consuming -- to the extent that some can no longer imagine working without it. ""I've been using it for more than a month, and I can't remember the last time something has wowed me this much,"" said Andres Asion, a broker from the Miami Real Estate Group. 'As soon as I tried it out, I was sold"" Recently, a client reached out to Asion with a problem: the woman had moved into a pre-construction home and couldn't open her windows. She had attempted to contact the developer for months with no response. Asion ran a copy of one of her emails through ChatGPT, asking it to rewrite it with an emphasis on the liability implications. ""ChatGPT wrote it as a legal issue and all of a sudden, the developer showed up at her house,"" he said. Asion has also used the tool to draft legally binding addendums and other documents, and sent them to lawyers for approval. ""I fine-tune all kinds of drafts with ChatGPT,"" he said. ""Sometimes I'll tell it to make it shorter or funnier, and it gives you so many samples to pick and edit from."" ChatGPT is free for now, but OpenAI, the company behind it, is reportedly considering a monthly charge of $42. Asion said ""it's not even a question"" he would pay for access. ""I would easily pay $100 or $200 a year for something like this,"" he said. ""I'd be crazy not to."" Frank Trelles, a commercial real estate agent at State Street Realty in Miami, said he'd also pay to keep using the tool, which has already impacted the way he does business. ""As soon as I tried it out, I was sold,"" he said. ""I went to sign up for a package, thinking it would be at least $100 a month, and was blown away that it was free. Nothing in this world is free though -- and that made me a bit nervous."" Trelles said he uses ChatGPT to look up the permitted uses for certain land and zones in Miami-Dade County, and calculate what mortgage payments or return on investment might be for a client, which typically involve formulas and mortgage calculators. ""I can be in a car with a client when they ask me what their mortgage payments might be,"" said Trelles. ""I can ask ChatGPT what a mortgage payment would be on a $14 million purchase at a 7.2% interest rate amortized over 25 years with two origination points at closing, and in two seconds, it gives me that information. It also explains how it got the answer. It's amazing."" Lots of potential, and some limitations There are some limitations, however. The tool has, for example, struggled with some basic math before. Trelles said it's helpful for approximations on the go, not for exact numbers. Serge Reda, a commercial real estate executive and adjunct professor at the Fordham Real Estate Institute, said some use cases for ChatGPT are better than others. ChatGPT may help save brokers time when writing listings or responses, but automating client responses may not be the best tactic because generating leads and closing transactions typically requires a personalized approach. ""It's accessible to everyone right now because it's free and they can get a taste of how this powerful tool can work. But there are definitely significant limitations,"" he said. While ChatGPT has generated a wave of interest among realtors, incorporating artificial intelligence in the real estate market isn't entirely new. Listing site Zillow, for example, has used AI for 3D mapping, creating automatic floor plans and for its Zestimate tool, which can scan pictures to see if a home has hardwood floors or stainless steel appliances so its price estimation better reflects market conditions. Earlier this week, Zillow rolled out an AI-feature that lets potential buyers conduct searches in a more natural language (something that's long been mastered by Google). Matt Kreamer, a spokesperson for Zillow, said the real estate industry has been slower to innovate, but ""I think we'll be seeing much bigger strides very soon."" He said Zillow sees no clear concerns with agents using ChatGPT to help streamline the work they already do and save time. ""We aren't promoting or wary of ChatGPT but are interested in how it's being used and watching it,"" he said. Although it's too early to say if the tool will become a mainstay in real estate, realtor Johannes believes AI in general will transform his industry and others. ""It may not be with ChatGPT,"" he said, ""but I believe some form of artificial intelligence like this will become a big part of how we work and live our lives."""
"Swimming in cash, Chevron plans a $75 billion slap in the face to drivers","Jan 27, 2023","While many blue-chip companies reported lower profits last year, Big Oil was having a moment. Crude prices surged, thanks in part to high demand and reduced supply. All of that helped make Chevron the top-performing Dow stock of last year, with shares surging more than 50%. To be clear: It's not that Chevron, or any of its peers, did anything special to earn their windfall profits last year. There was no big innovation or breakthrough — they just got rich off the price of oil shooting up. Now, when you're a profitable company, you have a lot of options for what to do with those profits. You can reinvest in the business, upgrading your equipment or hiring more people. You can issue a dividend to shareholders, as a treat. Or, in America, you can do a buyback, in which you use the profit to purchase your own stock on the open market. Buybacks are increasingly common, and controversial (in fact, they were flat-out illegal until 1982). On one hand it's an easy way for a company to reward shareholders and signal confidence in its own value (after all, what moron would buy shares in a company whose stock is about to go down?). But critics say the practice artificially inflates the stock's value by creating fake demand. Conveniently, it also gooses executive compensation, the vast majority of which comes from stock options. See here: Chevron, which is expected to report Friday that profits for 2022 doubled to more than $37 billion, is essentially balking at calls from the White House and some members of Congress to funnel its extra cash into more drilling capacity to help reduce prices for inflation-weary customers. Instead, Chevron is buying $75 billion worth of its own shares, and jacking up its quarterly shareholder dividend. That decision prompted rebuke from the Biden administration. ""For a company that claimed not too long ago that it was 'working hard' to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,"" said White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan. Chevron's buyback package is so large, according to Bloomberg, that it could fund more than four years of drilling and other projects. Representatives for the company didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Of course, Chevron and other US oil producers, including Exxon Mobil, are putting some money into new energy projects this year. But, according to Reuters, those expenditures will be dwarfed by the amounts paid to shareholders. Meanwhile, gas prices in the United States are marching higher every day, and are on track to once again breach $4 a gallon this spring. That is what a PR consultant might call bad optics. At least Chevron executives aren't all alone in making such bold calls. Railroads are also saying ""screw the optics"" and directing profits right back to shareholders. Earlier this week, Union Pacific, one of the major freight railroads that fought off union demands for paid sick days, reported another year of record earnings. As my colleague Chris Isidore reports, the company's employee pay and benefits rose 12% for the year, to $4.6 billion. That was far less than the $6.3 billion that Union Pacific spent repurchasing shares of stock. Enjoying Nightcap?

Goldman Sachs CEO got 30% pay cut -- but still made $25 million,"Jan 28, 2023","Goldman Sachs had a rough year in 2022. And CEO David Solomon was punished for that. Sort of. The investment banking giant said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday that Solomon received $25 million in annual compensation last year. While that is still a very large amount of money, it's down nearly 30% from the $35 million that Solomon raked in during 2021. Solomon's $2 million annual salary is unchanged. But the company said that his ""annual variable compensation,"" paid in a mix of performance-based restricted stock units and cash, was well below 2021 levels. The reason: Weaker earnings compared to 2021's results. Goldman Sachs shares also fell more than 10% in 2022, although that wasn't as big of a drop as the ones suffered by rivals Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Still, Goldman Sachs (like the rest of Wall Street) was hit hard by the slowdown in dealmaking last year. The company reported a 16% drop in revenue in the fourth quarter and profit plunge of 66% earlier this month, mainly due to the lack of merger activity and initial public offerings. In fact, earnings for Goldman Sachs missed Wall Street's consensus forecasts by the widest margin since the third quarter of 2011. Solomon said in the company's earnings release that the company faced ""a challenging economic backdrop."" Goldman Sachs is having a particularly tough time trying to branch beyond its traditional businesses of investment banking. The company's consumer-focused businesses have been losing money and Goldman Sachs is pulling back on some of its efforts to reach average banking customers as a result. And if Solomon finds himself short on cash, he can always pick up more DJ side gigs."
Some auto insurers are refusing to cover certain Hyundai and Kia models,"Jan 29, 2023","Progressive and State Farm, two of America's largest auto insurers, are refusing to write policies in certain cities for some older Hyundai and Kia models that have been deemed too easy to steal, according to the companies. Several reports say the companies have stopped offering insurance on these vehicles in cities that include Denver, Colorado and St. Louis, Missouri. The insurance companies did not tell CNN which cities or states were involved. The Highway Loss Data Institute released insurance claims data last September that confirmed what various social media accounts had been saying: Some 2015 through 2019 Hyundai and Kia models are roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of similar age, because many of them lack some of the basic auto theft prevention technology included in most other vehicles in those years, according to the HLDI. Specifically, these SUVs and cars don't have electronic immobilizers, which rely on a computer chip in the car and another in the key that communicate to confirm that the key really belongs to that vehicle. Without the right key, an immobilizer should do just that -- stop the car from moving. Immobilizers were standard equipment on 96% of vehicles sold for the 2015-2019 model years, according the HLDI, but only 26% of Hyundais and Kias had them at that time. Vehicles that have push-button start systems, rather than relying on metal keys that must be inserted and turned, have immobilizers, but not all models with turn-key ignitions do. Stealing these vehicles became a social media trend in 2021, according to HLDI, as car thieves began posting videos of their thefts and joyrides and even videos explaining how to steal the cars. In Wisconsin, where the crimes first became prevalent, theft claims of Hyundais and Kias spiked to more than 30 times 2019 levels in dollar terms. ""State Farm has temporarily stopped writing new business in some states for certain model years and trim levels of Hyundai and Kia vehicles because theft losses for these vehicles have increased dramatically,"" the insurer said in a statement provided to CNN. ""This is a serious problem impacting our customers and the entire auto insurance industry."" Progressive is also cutting back on insuring these cars in some markets, spokesman Jeff Sibel said in an emailed statement. ""During the past year we've seen theft rates for certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles more than triple and in some markets these vehicles are almost 20 times more likely to be stolen than other vehicles,"" he wrote. ""Given that we price our policies based on the level of risk they represent, this explosive increase in thefts in many cases makes these vehicles extremely challenging for us to insure. In response, in some geographic areas we have increased our rates and limited our sale of new insurance policies on some of these models."" Progressive continues to insure those who already have policies with the company, he said. Progressive is also providing them with advice on how to protect their vehicles from theft. Michael Barry, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, said it was very unusual for auto insurers to simply stop writing new policies on a given make or model of vehicle. ""They generally want to expand their market share depending on where they're doing business,"" he said. Hyundai and Kia operate as separate companies in the United States, but Hyundai Motor Group owns a large stake in Kia and various Hyundai and Kia models share much of their engineering. Engine immobilizers are now standard on all Kia and Hyundai vehicles, the companies said in separate statements. Both automakers also said they are developing security software for vehicles that were not originally equipped with an immobilizer. Kia said it has begun notifying owners of the availability of this software, which will be provided at no charge. Hyundai said its free software free update will be available next month. Hyundai also said it is providing free steering wheel locks to some police departments around the country to give local residents who have Hyundai models that could be easily stolen. Hyundai dealers are also selling and installing security kits for the vehicles, the company said. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the cost of Hyundai security kits."
Gautam Adani's business loses $50 billion in market value after short seller report,"Jan 27, 2023","The value of Gautam Adani's business empire has crashed by more than $50 billion this week since Hindenburg Research, a US firm that makes money from short selling, published a blistering report accusing it of fraud. India's Adani Group has denounced Hindenburg's allegations as ""baseless"" and ""malicious,"" and it is considering legal action. But the sharp sell-off in shares, which began Wednesday, accelerated Friday after US hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman said he found the short seller's report credible. Hindenburg Research published an investigation on Adani's conglomerate late on Tuesday, accusing it of ""brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades."" It said it had taken a short position in Adani Group companies, meaning it would benefit from a drop in their value. Shares of those companies — some of which had surged over 500% in the last few years — plunged when India's stock market opened Wednesday. The rout resumed Friday when trading resumed following a market holiday on Thursday. Shares of Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas and Adani Green Energy — three of the group's seven listed companies — were down 20% each on Friday, while shares of Adani Enterprises, the conglomerate's flagship company, fell 18%. Friday's losses wiped out almost $39 billion in market value. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Adani is still Asia's richest man with a personal fortune worth $113 billion, $30 billion more than fellow Indian entrepreneur Mukesh Ambani. Friday's losses will reduce that gap. Hindenburg said Thursday that it stood fully by its report and believed any legal action would be ""meritless."" ""If Adani is serious, it should also file suit in the US where we operate. We have a long list of documents we would demand in a legal discovery process,"" the short seller said in a post on Twitter. Hindenburg isn't the first research firm to express concern about the finances of Adani's sprawling empire, which has borrowed $30 billion to become established in industries ranging from logistics to mining, and is aggressively growing in diverse sectors such as media, data centers, airports and cement. Ackman weighed into the debate on Twitter Thursday, saying he found the Hindenburg investigation ""highly credible and extremely well researched."" ""We are not invested long or short in any of the Adani companies ... nor have we done our own independent research,"" Ackman added. Hindenburg's claims come at a sensitive time. Adani Enterprises is aiming to raise 200 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) by issuing new shares this month. The offer will close on Tuesday. A college dropout and a self-made industrialist, Adani is the world's fourth richest man, ahead of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. He is also seen as a close ally of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. The 60-year old tycoon founded the Adani group over 30 years ago."
Beer will cost more at this year's Super Bowl party,"Jan 31, 2023","Super Bowl LVII is right around the corner and there's a lot to celebrate this year, other than the game itself and Rihanna headlining the halftime show. And if you're a party host, it's likely to cost you less than it did a year ago to serve up several big ticket game-time dishes, except one important one. While overall food price inflation is up 11.8% over last year, prices on some popular snack items are down just in time for game day, according to a new Wells Fargo Super Bowl Food Report. With beverages, brace for sticker shock on at least a few Super Bowl must-haves for the grownups - beer. Beer prices this year have jumped 11% from a year earlier, while wine and spirits are up 4% and 2%, respectively according to the report. Load up on wings and guac There is some relief in the budget for food, however. Wing fans will like this: A pound of chicken wings is down 22% from January 2022 because of more supply. Last year at this time, the retail price for whole chicken wings was $3.38 per pound for the week of Super Bowl LVI, according to the US Department of Agriculture's weekly retail price report. ""It came down to $2.65 per pound in early January,"" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist at Wells Fargo. ""Chicken wings were so expensive last year that consumers were looking for alternatives to serve at the party. Poultry producers then brought in a significant increase in supply and now it's at the highest level of supply since early 2019."" If you're grilling, sirloin steak prices have dropped almost $1 per pound and bacon is also cheaper than last year, said Swanson. So is shrimp, as lower demand helped push down prices by 17% to $3.78 a pound, compared to a year ago. Go crazy with guacamole, too, because avocados are at a bargain. The average retail price for an avocado is down 20% since last year, after a significant supply glut of the buttery fruit triggered a drop in wholesale prices. That's a welcome reversal from 2022, when avocado prices surged in the first half of the year after a brief stoppage of avocado imports from Mexico roiled the supply chain and inflated prices. ""The dollar amount per person at this year's Super Bowl party ultimately depends on what they drink and consume,"" said Swanson. The 57th Super Bowl will take place on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona."
"Global economic outlook slightly 'less gloomy' than expected, IMF says","Jan 31, 2023","The global economy will weaken this year as rising interest rates and Russia's war in Ukraine continue to weigh on activity. But economists are more optimistic than they were just a few months ago. The International Monetary Fund said Monday that it now expects global growth will slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023. That's up from a forecast of 2.7% in October. The upgrade in the outlook reflects China's ""sudden reopening,"" which the IMF said ""paves the way for a rapid rebound in activity."" It also cited unexpected resilience in numerous economies in the second half of 2022, as well as an improvement in global financial conditions as inflation starts to ease and the US dollar comes down from its highs. ""The outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining,"" Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's director of research, wrote in a blog post. New forecasts The IMF emphasized that growth this year ""will remain weak by historical standards."" (Between 2000 and 2019, the annual average was 3.8%.) Central banks will need to continue their aggressive campaign to reduce decades-high inflation, which will result in a slowdown of economic activity. It predicted that ""nine out of ten advanced economies will likely decelerate."" In the United States, growth is expected to slow from 2% in 2022 to 1.4% in 2023. Europe — whose economy has proved surprisingly hardy despite the region's energy crisis, in part due to a mild winter so far — is forecast to see growth among the 20 countries that use the euro drop from 3.5% to 0.7%. The United Kingdom is expected to experience a contraction of 0.6%. It's the only Group of Seven economy projected to shrink this year. Still, the IMF sees some improvements to the outlook. A major reason is China. Beijing ended its strict ""zero Covid"" policy late last year, reopening its borders and moving away from the harsh quarantine and testing policies that had held back growth in the world's second-largest economy. Its 3% expansion in 2022 was one of the country's worst performances in decades. The IMF now forecasts growth in China will rebound to 5.2% this year, notably higher than its previous estimate. Inflation trends are also promising. The IMF noted that ""overall measures [are] now decreasing in most countries,"" even if price increases for goods and services excluding food and energy have yet to peak in many cases. The headline annual reading of US inflation reached a high in June, while inflation in Europe has fallen since October, when it touched a record. Global inflation is forecast by the IMF to ease from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024. Before the pandemic, it was near 3.5%. A pullback in the strength of the US dollar since November, meanwhile, has been helpful for emerging market and developing economies. The greenback's steep rally had made it more expensive to import commodities, including food and energy, and raised the cost of paying interest on some debt. Risks to the outlook remain substantial, the IMF warned. China's recovery could lose steam if future coronavirus waves keep people at home or the vulnerable property sector slows sharply. Inflation could stay elevated for longer than central banks would like, mandating tighter monetary policy. The war in Ukraine remains a key source of uncertainty. An escalation could add to disruptions in food and energy markets. For now, though, it's feeling slightly better about the next 12 months — while stressing that they won't be easy. ""This time around, the global economic outlook hasn't worsened,"" Gourinchas wrote. ""That's good news, but not enough. The road back to a full recovery, with sustainable growth, stable prices and progress for all, is only starting."""
Mercedes leapfrogs past Tesla on automated highway driving,"Jan 28, 2023","Mercedes-Benz will take a step towards offering a self driving car in the United States, or at least in some states, when it begins selling cars featuring its new Drive Pilot system later this year. Mercedes' Drive Pilot system is designed to work on highways in dense traffic at speeds of less than 40 miles per hour. Unlike traffic jam assist features already available throughout the US on a number of luxury models today, including Mercedes-Benz cars, the Drive Pilot system allows the driver to entirely disengage from the act of driving. When the system is in operation, Mercedes considers it safe for the driver not to pay attention to the road -- although the driver still has to be ready to take back control if needed, such as if the traffic situation changes or if the system encounters an unusual situation it's not capable of handling. The Mercedes system is considered Level 3 Automation, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. It's more automated than a Level 2 system, like Tesla's Autopilot, General Motors' Super Cruise and Ford's BlueCruise, in which the vehicle's brakes and steering operate on their own in certain situations but the driver is still required to pay attention to the road at all times. In a Level 3 system, ""You are not driving when these automated driving features are engaged - even if you are seated 'in the driver's seat,'"" according to the SAE The driver could, for instance, check emails on their phone or watch a video. Even Tesla's Autopilot and so-called ""Full Self-Driving"" technologies require that the driver pay attention to the road outside the car at all times. ""In the modern world, time is one of the most precious commodities, and giving back time to our customers is a core element in our strategy to build the world's most desirable cars,"" said Markus Schäfer, chief technology officer for Mercedes-Benz. The system complies with Nevada's traffic regulations for autonomous vehicles, according to Mercedes, which says it hopes to get certification in California soon. The system will be available on model year 2024 Mercedes EQS and S-class models, which go on sale in the US later this year. The system will only work on certain mapped highways in states where it has been deemed legal such as Nevada and, possibly soon, California. Among other technologies, the Mercedes system relies on lidar, which is similar to radar but uses laser light, rather than radio waves, to detect objects in its surroundings. Lidar can provide much more detail about a vehicles' surroundings than radar or cameras alone and many experts feel it is a necessity for safe autonomous vehicles. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, however, has said cameras alone are sufficient. The Mercedes system also uses a rear-facing a camera in the back window, a microphone to listen for emergency vehicles and road wetness sensors inside the wheel well. It also relies on high-definition three-dimensional mapping data that's regularly updated as well as an ultra-precise vehicle positioning system that's much more accurate than ordinary GPS, according to Mercedes-Benz."
Why urgent care centers are popping up everywhere,"Jan 28, 2023","If you drive down a busy suburban strip mall or walk down a street in a major city, chances are you won't go long without spotting a Concentra, MedExpress, CityMD or another urgent care center. Demand at urgent care sites surged during the Covid-19 pandemic as people searched for tests and treatments. Patient volume has jumped 60% since 2019, according to the Urgent Care Association, an industry trade group. That has fueled growth for new urgent care centers. A record 11,150 urgent care centers have popped up around the United States and they are growing at 7% a year, the trade group says. (This does not include clinics inside retail stores like CVS' MinuteClinic or freestanding emergency departments.) Urgent care centers are designed to treat non-emergency conditions like a common cold, a sprained ankle, an ear infection, or a rash. They are recommended if patients can't get an immediate appointment with their primary care doctor or if patients don't have one. Primary care practices should always be the first call in these situations because they have access to patients' records and all of their health care history, while urgent care sites are meant to provide episodic care. Urgent care sites are often staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Many also have doctors on site. (One urgent care industry magazine says, in 2009, 70% of its providers were physicians, but that the percentage had fallen to 16% by last year.) Urgent cares usually offer medical treatment outside of regular doctor's office hours and a visit costs much less than a trip to the emergency room. Urgent care has grown rapidly because of convenience, gaps in primary care, high costs of emergency room visits, and increased investment by health systems and private-equity groups. The urgent care market will reach around $48 billion in revenue this year, a 21% increase from 2019, estimates IBISWorld. The growth highlights the crisis in the US primary care system. A shortage of up to 55,000 primary care physicians is expected in the next decade, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. But many doctors, health care advocates and researchers raise concerns at the proliferation of urgent care sites and say there can be downsides. Frequent visits to urgent care sites may weaken established relationships with primary care doctors. They can also lead to more fragmented care and increase overall health care spending, research shows. And there are questions about the quality of care at urgent care centers and whether they adequately serve low-income communities. A 2018 study by Pew Charitable Trusts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that antibiotics are overprescribed at urgent care centers, especially for common colds, the flu and bronchitis. ""It's a reasonable solution for people with minor conditions that can't wait for primary care providers,"" said Vivian Ho, a health economist at Rice University. ""When you need constant management of a chronic illness, you should not go there."" The urgent care center boom Urgent care centers have been around in the United States since the 1970s, but they were long derided as ""docs in a box"" and grew slowly during their early years. They have become more popular over the past two decades in part due to pressures on the primary care system. People's expectations of wait times have changed and it can be difficult, and sometimes almost impossible, to book an immediate visit with a primary care provider. Urgent care sites are typically open for longer hours during the weekday and on weekends, making it easier to get an appointment or a walk-in visit. Around 80% of the US population is within a 10-minute drive of an urgent care center, according to the industry trade group. ""There's a need to keep up with society's demand for quick turnaround, on-demand services that can't be supported by underfunded primary care,"" said Susan Kressly, a retired pediatrician and fellow at the American Academy of Pediatrics. Health insurers and hospitals have also become more focused on keeping people out of the emergency room. Emergency room visits are around ten times more expensive than visits to an urgent care center. During the early 2000s, hospital systems and health insurers started opening their own urgent care sites, and they have introduced strategies to deter emergency room visits. Additionally, passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 spurred an increase in urgent care providers as millions of newly insured Americans sought out health care. Private-equity and venture capital funds also poured billions into deals for urgent care centers, according to data from PitchBook. Urgent care centers can be attractive to investors. Unlike ERs, which are legally obligated to treat everyone, urgent care sites can essentially choose their patients and the conditions they treat. Many urgent care centers don't accept Medicaid and can turn away uninsured patient,s unless they pay a fee. Like other health care options, urgent care centers make money by billing insurance companies for the cost of the visit, additional services, or the patient pays out of pocket. In 2016, the median charge for a 30-minute new insured patient visit was $242 at an urgent care center, compared with $294 in a primary care office and $109 in a retail clinic, according to a study by FAIR Health, a nonprofit that collects health insurance data. ""If they can make it a more convenient option, there's a lot of revenue here,"" said Ateev Mehrotra, a professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School who has researched urgent care clinics. ""It's not where the big bucks are in health care, but there's a substantial number of patients."" Mehrotra research has found that between 2008 and 2015, urgent care visits increased 119%. They became the dominant venue for people seeking treatment for low-acuity conditions like acute respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, rashes, and muscle strains. Equity concerns Some doctors and researchers worry that patients with primary care doctors -- and those without -- are substituting urgent care visits in place of a primary care provider. ""What you don't want to see is people seeking a lot care outside their pediatrician and decreasing their visits to their primary care provider,"" said Rebecca Burns, the urgent care medical director at the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Burns' research has found that high urgent care reliance fills a need for children with acute issues but has the potential to disrupt primary care relationships. The National Health Law Program, a health care advocacy group for low-income families and communities, has called for state regulations to require coordination among urgent care sites, retail clinics, primary services, and hospitals to ensure continuity of patients' care. And while the presence of urgent care centers does prevent people from costly emergency department visits for low-acuity issues, Mehrotra from Harvard has found that, paradoxically, they increase health care spending on net. Each $1,646 visit to the ER for a low-acuity condition prevented was offset by a $6,327 increase in urgent care center costs, his research has found. This is in part because people may be going to urgent care for minor illnesses they would have previously treated with chicken soup. There are also concerns about the oversaturation of urgent care centers in higher-income areas that have more consumers with private health care and limited access in medically underserved areas. Urgent care centers selectively tend not to serve rural areas, areas with a high concentration of low-income patients, and areas with a low concentration of privately-insured patients, researchers at the University of California at San Francisco found in a 2016 study. They said this ""uneven distribution may potentially exacerbate health disparities."""
McDonald's is testing a new strawless lid,"Jan 27, 2023","Just like the McRib, straws might be a thing of the past at McDonald's. The chain has begun testing strawless lids in some US cities as part of a multi-year effort to make its packaging more environmentally friendly. ""These lids help optimize our packaging and eliminate the use of small plastics, just one example of the many solutions we're reviewing as part of our ongoing global commitment to reduce waste,"" a McDonald's spokesperson said in a statement. The plastic lids have a pullback tab to prevent the drink from splashing out. To drink from it, customers have to pull the tab back and slot it into a small opening. It's similar to the ""sippy cup"" lid at Starbucks that has been in use for the past three years. Restaurant Business Online, which first noticed the new McDonald's lids, spotted the new lids being tested in Minneapolis. Customers can still request a straw if needed, the report said. For the past several years, fast food chains in particular have been trying to figure out ways to reduce waste and go green. In particular, plastic straws can increase ocean pollution and microplastics that can harm marine wildlife. McDonald's set a goal in 2018 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its offices and restaurants by 36% between 2015 and 2030. In 2021, the chain switched out some of its plastic Happy Meal toys for 3-D paper-based toys that customers can put together themselves."
US court rejects J&J bankruptcy strategy for tens of thousands of talc lawsuits,"Jan 31, 2023","Johnson & Johnson's strategy to use bankruptcy to resolve the multibillion-dollar litigation over claims its talc products cause cancer was rejected by a federal appeals court on Monday, but the healthcare conglomerate said it would challenge the ruling. The decision by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia removed from bankruptcy the company's LTL Management unit, which was facing more than 38,000 legal claims tied to products such as its Johnson's baby powder. J&J shares were down about 3% in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. J&J, which maintains and reiterated on Monday that its talc products are safe, created and spun off LTL and assigned its talc liabilities to the unit and placed it in bankruptcy in 2021. J&J had argued that bankruptcy provided a way to resolve tens of thousands of legal claims more efficiently and fairly than taking the cases to trial individually. The company pledged a funding ""backstop"" to ensure LTL could pay talc claimants. The appeals court said it dismissed the LTL Chapter 11 petition because the unit was created solely to access the bankruptcy system. ""Applied here, while LTL faces substantial future talc liability, its funding backstop plainly mitigates any financial distress foreseen on its petition date,"" said the 56-page opinion by the three-judge panel. J&J said it will challenge the Third Circuit's ruling and continue to seek a resolution of the lawsuits in bankruptcy court. ""As we have said from the beginning of this process, resolving this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible is in the best interests of claimants and all stakeholders,"" J&J spokeswoman Allison Fennell said. ""We continue to stand behind the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder, which is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer."" J&J used a restructuring strategy known as the ""Texas two-step"" that was criticized by lawmakers and academics who argued the maneuver could provide a blueprint for other big companies to avoid juries in mass tort lawsuits. Before the bankruptcy filing, J&J faced costs from $3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements, including one in which 22 women were awarded a judgment of more than $2 billion, according to bankruptcy court records. But more than 1,500 talc lawsuits have been dismissed without J&J having to pay anything, and the majority of cases that have gone to trial have resulted in defense verdicts, mistrials or judgments for the company on appeal, according to LTL's court filings. The appeals court was urged to dismiss the bankruptcy petition by plaintiffs suing over the talc products. They argued one of the world's largest healthcare companies should not be using bankruptcy to protect itself from lawsuits. The cancer victims asked the appeals court to overrule a New Jersey bankruptcy judge who had allowed LTL's bankruptcy to continue. LTL's bankruptcy filing automatically stopped lawsuits from proceeding against it, and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in Trenton, New Jersey ruled in February that LTL's bankruptcy should also stop talc lawsuits from proceeding against parent company J&J. Kaplan said the bankruptcy court is better equipped to handle mass tort litigation than other courts."
CEO pay cuts could be just the start,"Jan 31, 2023","Corporate boards are slashing the pay of some leading CEOs in a new trend that could just be getting started. The pay cuts are hitting some of America's best-known and highest-paid bosses, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. The moves follow a dreadful year in the stock market -- 2022 was the S&P 500's worst year since 2008 -- and come as a growing number of corporations lay off rank-and-file workers to brace for a potential recession. For example, Goldman Sachs laid off 3,200 employees earlier this month amid a downturn in Wall Street dealmaking. The bank then disclosed on Friday that Solomon's 2022 pay is being cut by nearly 30%. Goldman Sachs' profit dropped 49% last year as the slowdown in dealmaking curbed advisory fees. ""This is a show of solidarity. CEOs need to share the pain,"" said Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises institutional investors on corporate governance matters. A similar pay cut could be coming for Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google parent Alphabet. After Alphabet announced 12,000 job cuts this month, Pichai told employees that top executives would take a ""very significant"" pay cut, Business Insider reported. Google did not respond to a request for comment. 'Still overpaid' But don't feel too badly for these top execs. They're still raking in serious cash and stock awards, just not quite as much as in the past. Apple, for example, said it is cutting the target pay package of Cook by 40%. But that still leaves him with a massive $49 million in total compensation. ""They are still overpaid. Let me be super clear about that,"" said Minow. Among the 500 largest public companies by revenue, the median CEO made $14.2 million in fiscal 2021, up 18.9% from the year before, according to the latest research from Equilar. Tech bosses have received the biggest pay hikes, with the median CEO pay surging by 42.1% in 2021 to $19.1 million, Equilar said. Say on pay effect? Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley announced Gorman made $31.5 million in total compensation for 2022, down 10% from the year before. The Wall Street bank said its compensation committee took into consideration the fact that ""in a challenging economic and market environment firm performance for 2022 was not as strong as the prior year"" when it enjoyed record results. Minow is relieved that some boards are imposing pain on CEOs. ""That's exactly the way pay is supposed to work,"" Minow said. ""The problem with pay traditionally is it's been all upside and no downside. CEOs would often get all the credit and money for good times and then blame El Nino or some extraneous force for the downside. Now they are being forced to accept more responsibility."" Of course, some of that responsibility is coming because the rules have changed. After the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, regulators have required public companies to give shareholders a voice on compensation issues. So-called ""Say on Pay"" votes are advisory, meaning companies can still go forward even if 100% of shareholders vote no. Still, having shareholders reject pay packages is an embarrassment companies try to avoid. Last year, JPMorgan Chase suffered a blow when its shareholders voted down a massive $52.6 million retention bonus that was planned for CEO Jamie Dimon. This month, JPMorgan announced Dimon's pay will be unchanged at $34.5 million -- even though wages are rising for average workers. The bank also said it decided not to give Dimon a special award for the year. That means Dimon's pay isn't budging even as wages go up for many employees."
Why gas prices are surging this month,"Jan 28, 2023","Normally, prices at the gas pump drift lower during the dead of winter as lousy weather keeps Americans off the roads. But something unusual is happening this year: Gas prices are rocketing higher. The national average for regular gas jumped to $3.51 a gallon on Friday, according to AAA. Although that's a far cry from the record of $5.02 a gallon last June, gas prices have increased by 12 cents in the past week and 41 cents in the past month. All told, the national average has climbed by more than 9% since the end of last year -- the biggest increase to start a year since 2009, according to Bespoke Investment Group. AAA says some states have experienced much bigger gains over the past month, including Colorado (98 cents), Georgia (70 cents), Delaware (62 cents), Ohio (60 cents) and Florida (59 cents). The unusual wintertime jump in gas price is drawing eye rolls from American drivers already grappling with high prices at the supermarket. It also threatens to undermine improvements in the inflation crisis that gripped the economy much of last year. So, why are gas prices jumping? It's not because of demand, which remains weak, even for this time of the year. Instead, the problem is supply. Refinery troubles The extreme weather in much of the United States near the end of last year caused a series of outages at the refineries that produce the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel that keep the economy humming. For example, Colorado's sole refinery, the Suncor refinery outside of Denver, was disrupted by freezing temperatures. When the refinery tried to restart, it suffered a fire and equipment got damaged. Suncor has indicated that refinery -- which Lipow Oil Associates says represents 17% of the Rocky Mountain region's refinery capacity -- could be offline for at least weeks. That helps explain why gas prices in Colorado have surged by nearly $1 a gallon over the past month. Refineries elsewhere have been sidelined by extreme weather as well. US refineries are operating at just 86% of capacity, down from the mid-90% range at the start of December, according to Bespoke. Oil prices bounce off lows Beyond the refinery problems, oil prices have crept higher, helping to drive prices at the pump northward. Since tumbling to $71.02 a barrel on December 9, US oil prices have jumped about 16%, to around $82.30 on Friday. That increase has been driven in part by expectations of higher worldwide demand as China relaxes its Covid-19 policies. At the same time, the oil markets are no longer receiving massive injections of emergency oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Biden administration has shifted from releasing unprecedented amounts of oil from that stockpile to beginning the process of refilling it. The good news is that some of the refinery problems may prove to be temporary, meaning supply should catch up with demand. The bad news is some experts are warning gas prices may keep going higher anyway. GasBuddy warns of $4 gas by March Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, expects the national average will hit $3.65 a gallon heading into the spring. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, worries the typical springtime jump in prices will be pulled forward. ""Instead of $4 a gallon happening in May, it could happen as early as March,"" De Haan told CNN. ""There is more upside risk than downside risk."" A return of $4 gas would be painful to drivers and could dent consumer confidence. Moreover, pain at the pump would complicate the inflation picture as the Federal Reserve debates whether to slow its interest rate hiking campaign. The Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model is now pointing to a 0.6% month-over-month increase for the Consumer Price Index for January. If that holds true, it would represent a significant acceleration compared with the 0.1% drop in prices between November and December."
Advertised salary ranges are not set in stone. That's why you still have to negotiate,"Jan 28, 2023","Now that more and more states are requiring companies to advertise salary ranges for open roles, you may assume the range is the range and you can't negotiate for more. Not true. While the new pay transparency laws mean you'll have more information about what an employer is willing to pay, the ranges advertised likely won't give you an accurate picture of what you might be paid for the actual role you're applying for. So unless you do your own research, ask questions and then negotiate, you might shortchange yourself. ""I've seen people deterred from negotiating because they think [the advertised pay range] is set in stone. We haven't found that to be the case,"" said Brandon Bramley, founder of The Salary Negotiator, which provides one-on-one consultation for people seeking to improve their pay packages and online courses in salary negotiation. What you need to know about published ranges Here are three reasons why a published salary range is hardly the whole story: 1. The range may not be the ""full"" range: Some employers only publish ranges between, say, the 25th and 75th percentiles of what they pay for a given position, said Lulu Seikaly, a senior attorney and pay transparency expert at Payscale. ""A lot of organizations won't post the entire range. It just has to be a good faith estimate."" What's more, Seikaly added, even if an employer publishes the full range for a job, employers are legally allowed to pay more to the right candidate. ""There's always flexibility to offer more than the top of the range,"" she said. 2. The published range may be very wide: It's not hard to find advertised salary ranges so wide you could drive a truck through them. Think yawning gaps of $100,000 or more between the minimum and the maximum. Some employers may do so because they're using one posting to attract applicants for a few roles under the same general function — such as a software engineer. But each role is suitable to people at different levels of experience (such as a junior engineer, a mid-level engineer or a senior one), Seikaly noted. Similarly, an employer may publish the same wide range for each of several jobs with different responsibilities. And sometimes, it's not clear what an employer is thinking. Companies are in the trial-and-error stage of compliance since pay transparency laws are quite new and vary from place to place. The oldest one on the books, in Colorado, has only been in place for two years. Pay transparency laws in California and the state of Washington went into effect on January 1. And employers in New York City only started advertising pay three months ago, while employers in the rest of New York State won't have to do so until September. When a range is laughably broad — Seikaly cited one posting that included a range of $90,000 to $900,000 — she believes the company is making ""a very big branding mistake"" because it appears as if they are not offering a good faith estimate and potential applicants might well be wary. ""It's a big red flag that they don't value employees,"" she said. 3. The range typically reflects base salary only: There is a lot more to your compensation than your regular paycheck. The published range for an open role usually just reflects your base pay, not bonuses, equity and annual increases. And all those parts are often negotiable for the candidate a company wants most, even if a hiring manager or recruiter asserts that they're not, Bramley said. What's more, there are other negotiable parts of compensation that can augment your pay package, such as tuition reimbursement, a home office stipend and additional paid time off. Negotiating the best number for you Don't take advertised ranges as gospel. Instead: Do your own compensation research: Bramley recommends getting pay averages from three pay data aggregators such as Payscale and Comparably. That way you'll be able to gauge whether the employer's published range is within reason for the role you're seeking. Get more information on the employer's published range: If you're considering applying for a job with a wide pay range, ask the recruiter what specific role the employer wants to slot you into and what the specific pay band is for that role. Then ask what skills and experience justify their offering a candidate pay at the top of the range. Some companies may most typically offer to pay candidates at the midpoint of the range unless the candidate is more junior or senior, said talent hiring executive Rachel Levine. An employer may choose to pay a candidate above the top of the advertised range if someone brings additional value or an exceptional skillset to the role than what current employees in that role have, Levine said. Avoid sharing your pay expectations prematurely: Many states and localities ban organizations from asking job applicants what they're currently making. So instead recruiters early on will ask you what your pay expectations are. ""You get a lot of pressure to share,"" Bramley said. The risk is you will offer a number below what an employer is actually willing to pay the right candidate, thereby limiting what you might get in the end. ""Flip the script when asked about your salary expectations,"" Bramley suggested. ""Ask what range they had in the mind for those who are best qualified."" Or, he added, you might say, ""To be honest, my expectation may be near the top [of the advertised range]. But it's hard to say right now because I want to learn more about the company, the role and its compensation structure."" It pays to ask for more: Once you have an offer in hand, you will be in the strongest position to negotiate for more because you know they want you, and most of the time you can secure something extra, Bramley said. But even if you can't, he has never seen an offer rescinded because someone tried. ""The worst case is they say 'No',"" Bramley said."
China still wants to control Big Tech. It's just pulling different strings,"Jan 27, 2023","Investors have raced back into Chinese tech stocks this year, encouraged by an apparent truce in a two-year battle between some of the country's most powerful regulators and its biggest internet companies. But the enthusiasm may prove to be premature; Beijing is tightening its grip on household names such as Alibaba by acquiring so-called ""golden shares"" that allow government officials to be directly involved in their businesses, including having a say in the content they provide to hundreds of millions of people. Earlier this month, a fund controlled by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) took a 1% stake in Alibaba's digital media subsidiary in Guangzhou, according to business data platform Qichacha. The subsidiary — Guangzhou Lujiao Information Technology — has a portfolio of businesses under its wing, including mobile browser UCWeb and streaming video site Youku Tudou. According to Qichacha, a new board member, who has the same name as a mid-level official at the CAC, was appointed to the subsidiary at the same time. Alibaba didn't respond to CNN request for comments. Calls to the CAC went unanswered. According to a person familiar with the matter, the Chinese government is also discussing taking a similar stake in a mainland Chinese subsidiary of Tencent, the group that includes WeChat and a vast gaming business. The terms have not been finalized yet, the person said. Tencent declined to comment. Iron grip remains The moves come as Beijing has signaled that its two-year onslaught on the internet industry is coming to an end. As the economy falters, the ruling Communist Party needs the private sector to boost jobs and growth. But that doesn't mean China is changing its attitude towards companies it believes have become too powerful. ""It wasn't a change of heart that caused Beijing to pull back its regulatory push on tech companies, it was a concession to economic reality,"" said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong. ""The goal of furthering state control over sprawling tech empires, however, wasn't abandoned."" Instead, Beijing is returning to the ""golden shares"" approach, by which the state can still assert control over these firms, while moderating its impact on markets, Silvers added. ""Golden shares"" give their owners, usually governments, some level of control over companies, often those that were previously state-owned. In China, such shares are called ""special management shares"" and give the government decisive voting rights or veto power over certain business decisions or — in the case of internet companies — content. The policy could present a ""nightmare"" scenario for foreign investors, said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. That's because the Biden administration has issued a series of executive orders limiting securities investments in Chinese entities that the US suspects of aiding China's military. ""This represents a murky grey zone for investors, as the CCP's presence spills over into all areas, both military and civil,"" Capri said. ""American and other foreign investors will struggle to perform due diligence in an opaque Chinese system."" Old approach, same end The Chinese government first introduced ""golden shares"" in 2013 with the aim of strengthening its control over state-backed media firms, which were later opened up to private investors. But as the mobile internet took off, it took such shares in a number of private tech firms operating news and video apps to maintain its grip over information on the internet. Between 2018 and 2022, several government entities took 1% stakes in popular news and content platforms, including US-listed Sina Weibo, 36kr, and Qutoutiao, and Hong Kong-listed Kuaishou, according to company filings or public registration records. ""Beijing's Golden Share initiative is about embedding the Chinese Communist Party within the nerve-centers of China's most important internet-content companies,"" said Capri. ""It's about achieving pervasive surveillance, censorship and policing capabilities from the inside out,"" he added. In April 2021, a government entity acquired a 1% stake in a Beijing subsidiary of TikTok's parent company Bytedance, according to Qichacha. The subsidiary controls some Chinese operating licenses for Douyin and Toutiao. Douyin is the country's most popular short-video app with more than 600 million active users. Toutiao is a news aggregation app. Later that year, an executive at TikTok said at a US congressional hearing that TikTok had ""no affiliation"" with the Bytedance subsidiary. No easy return Beijing has tried to arrest a rapid slowdown in the country's economy by hitting pause on the heavy-handed tech crackdown. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week that China will support the growth of the private sector, while opening its door further to foreign investment. But investors may not be so easily enticed to return to China, analysts said. The Communist Party may be easing off on fines and penalties, but the ""golden shares"" approach seeks the same end, which is ""control and tight oversight,"" said Capri. Silver pointed out that not only will government control of listed entities likely raise risks with an increasingly wary US administration, but Western institutional investors may be reluctant to invest alongside Beijing. ""The risk is that shareholder interests will remain subservient to state interests,"" he said."
This budget airline is making record profits,"Jan 31, 2023","Ryanair expects it will be able to charge higher prices for flights over Easter and the summer, thanks to strong demand from American and Asian tourists and less competition from rivals. The low-cost European carrier told customers in an earnings statement on Monday to ""book early"" before cheaper tickets sell out. It reported record profit for the three months to December 31, increasing airfares by 14% compared to their pre-pandemic level. ""The return of Asian traffic to Europe and a particularly strong transatlantic marketplace driven by a very strong dollar will see robust demand both through the Easter and into the summer of 2023 for short-haul flights across Europe,"" CEO Michael O'Leary said in a video posted to the company's website. The collapse of rival airlines during the pandemic and cuts by competitors to fleets and passenger capacity would also underpin Ryanair's strong traffic numbers ""hopefully at higher fares,"" O'Leary said. The Dublin-based airline has emerged from the coronavirus pandemic in a strong position, even as several of its competitors went bankrupt or needed government-backed bailouts. The latest casualty was small UK regional carrier Flybe, which filed for bankruptcy and ceased trading over the weekend. Ryanair has also managed to avoid the staff shortages that have plagued rivals, leaving it well positioned to take advantage of a swift recovery in air travel following the pandemic. ""We're seeing very strong market share gains in most of our major markets like Italy, Poland, Ireland and Spain where competitors have removed significant capacity or are retreating from competition with us,"" O'Leary said. Passenger numbers for the quarter through December climbed to a record 38.4 million. That's 7% higher than the same quarter in 2019 before the pandemic hit. Fares for the quarter were higher than in 2019 ""because of a very strong Christmas and New Year period,"" according to O'Leary. The airline posted its highest ever third-quarter profit, earning €211 million ($230 million) for the three months through December compared to a loss of €96 million ($105 million) for the same period in 2021. That beat its previous record in 2017 of €106 million ($115.5 million), according to Reuters, and was more than double the result for the comparable quarter in 2019. The Irish airline expects to carry 168 million passengers in the 12 months through March 2023, 13% higher than the year before the coronavirus, which was its previous record. It expects that number to grow to 185 million passengers over the 12 months to March 2024. The airline said its growth forecast was based on the delivery of 124 ""Gamechanger"" Boeing 737 aircraft for the summer peak, but warned that some of those deliveries could ""slip."" Ryanair has in the past been openly critical of Boeing's ""inability to meet its delivery schedule."""
Prosecutors say Sam Bankman-Fried tried to obscure his crimes with Robinhood's stock,"Jan 31, 2023","Federal prosecutors said FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's efforts to control about $500 million worth of Robinhood shares last year indicates steps the former crypto entrepreneur has taken to ""obscure"" his alleged crimes. Prosecutors have since seized the stock and other assets totaling more than $700 million after Bankman-Fried laid claim to the shares saying he legitimately bought them and needed the money to defend against the criminal charges he's facing. In a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan involving Bankman-Fried's bail, prosecutors argued he should still be prevented from moving FTX assets. ""Since the Government's seizure, the defendant has claimed that he would direct the majority of these funds toward making customers whole, but the original circumstances of the purchase of these shares, through a foreign special purpose vehicle with no public connection to FTX or Alameda, further indicate the steps the defendant has taken to obscure his criminal misuse of FTX customer property,"" they wrote. The new allegation comes as prosecutors and lawyers for Bankman-Fried have been going back and forth over the terms of his bail after authorities alleged he made contact with the former general counsel of FTX in what they said suggests witness tampering. Prosecutors want to limit who Bankman-Fried can be in touch with from FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research. They also want to restrict him from using encrypted messaging apps after he previously used them at FTX with the auto-delete feature turned on. Bankman-Fried's lawyers asked for the limitations of his contact with FTX assets be lifted since prosecutors have not proven he was behind a mysterious transfer. They also proposed some limits to his contact with former employees. Prosecutors have been suspicious of Bankman-Fried's contact with Bahamian regulators after millions of dollars in assets were made available to customers there just before FTX filed for US bankruptcy court protection. In the letter, they say Bankman-Fried told Gary Wang, a former top FTX executive who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors, ""that he wanted to stall with the U.S. bankruptcy in order to assist the foreign regulators, whom he thought would be more lenient with him and who might permit him to regain control of FTX."" Bankman-Fried was charged with stealing billions of dollars from FTX customers in what prosecutors have described as one of the largest financial frauds in US history. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty. He has been released on a $250 million bond. Also on Monday, a federal judge granted numerous media organizations request to make public the names of individuals who co-signed Bankman-Fried's bail. The judge paused his ruling until February 7 to allow time for Bankman-Fried's attorneys to appeal his ruling given the ""novel"" legal issue in the case. Correction: A previous version of this article provided the wrong date for the judge to unpause his Monday ruling. The judge paused his ruling until February 7."
"CVS and Walmart cut pharmacy hours, close some locations earlier, citing staffing shortage","Jan 28, 2023","An apparent shortage of pharmacists is forcing CVS and Walmart to reduce the hours of its pharmacies, as they close earlier in thousands of locations. Beginning in March, both retailers will either cut or shift the hours that their pharmacies operate in response to staffing shortages and waning consumer demand as the height of the Covid-19 pandemic recedes. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Walmart, which has pharmacies in most of its 4,600 US locations, will close them two hours earlier, at 7 pm. CVS will shift or cut hours at about 6,000 US pharmacies. For CVS, adjusting its hours is an attempt to ensure its ""pharmacy teams are available to serve patients when they're most needed,"" the company said in a statement to CNN. The changes are part of its ""regular course of business,"" it added, so its hours meet customer demand. In a statement to CNN, Walmart said the new hours are the result of ""direct feedback"" from its pharmacy employees and customers. ""Walmart has a strong and incredible pharmacy team, and we are making this change to not only enhance their work-life balance but also to maintain the best level of service for our customers,"" a Walmart spokesperson said. ""By positioning our teams in the hours where our customers say they want to visit our pharmacy, we are better able to deliver excellent customer service."" Walgreens announced last year that it was reducing hours at some of its pharmacies because of staffing shortages. On Friday, the company told CNN that it has ""at times had to adjust store or pharmacy hours at some of our locations as we work to balance staffing and resources in the market to best meet our patient and customer demand."" A Walgreens spokesperson added that it has seen ""positive staffing trends for the past several months as we work to return more stores to normal operating hours."" Pharmacists are facing a staffing crunch that's hit many other fields of work, but it is particularly affecting locally owned pharmacies. According to a survey released last year by the National Community Pharmacists Association, more than three-quarters of community pharmacists are having a ""tough time filling open positions,"" which is resulting in longer wait times for customers."
Prosecutors say Sam Bankman-Fried's contact with FTX's ex-general counsel is 'suggestive' of witness tampering,"Jan 28, 2023","Federal prosecutors said FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried contacted the former general counsel of the crypto trading platform earlier this month in a move they say may constitute witness tampering. A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Prosecutors with the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York asked the judge to amend Bankman-Fried's bail conditions to prohibit him from communicating with current or former employees of FTX or its sister hedge fund Alameda research unless he is with his attorney or has approval from the government. They also want the judge to block Bankman-Fried from using any encrypted communication devices out of concerns he will obstruct the ongoing investigation. Prosecutors said in a letter to the judge that Bankman-Fried contacted the former general counsel of FTX on January 15 using Signal and email — stating, ""I would really love to reconnect and see if there's a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other."" That contact, prosecutors said, is suggestive of witness tampering since the ex-general counsel, who is identified as ""Witness-1,"" may testify against Bankman-Fried at trial. ""Efforts by the defendant to improve his relationship with potential witnesses that may testify against him may itself constitute witness tampering,"" prosecutors wrote. ""The Government has interviewed Witness-1, who has firsthand knowledge of the defendant's conduct during the charged conspiracies, including during the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Witness-1 participated in Signal and Slack communications with the defendant and a small group of company insiders during the relevant events of November 2022. In those messages, among other things, the defendant gave instructions for liquidating Alameda's investments to satisfy FTX customer withdrawals, and indicated that he transferred approximately $45 million dollars of Alameda funds to FTX US to fill an apparent hole in FTX US's balance sheet,"" prosecutors said. Prosecutors said it's likely that many of FTX and Alameda's current and former employees will be witnesses at the trial, adding that their investigation is ongoing and they are still identifying potential witnesses. In addition to limiting Bankman-Fried's contact with former colleagues, prosecutors want to restrict his use of Signal and Slack, messaging apps that enable users to auto-delete messages after a certain time period. Prosecutors say Caroline Ellison, the former chief executive of Alameda who pleaded guilty and is cooperating, informed them that Bankman-Fried indicated ""that many legal cases turn on documentation and it is more difficult to build a legal case if information is not written down or preserved."" Authorities said the lack of Slack and Signal communications has already ""impeded"" its investigation. Several potential witnesses told prosecutors of ""incriminating conversations"" they had with Bankman-Fried over the messaging platforms that were deleted because Bankman-Fried set the programs to auto-delete after 30 days."
Pakistani rupee plummets as markets adjust to removal of unofficial controls,"Jan 27, 2023","The Pakistani rupee fell 9.6% against the dollar on Thursday, central bank data showed — the biggest one-day drop in over two decades — in a slump that may persuade the International Monetary Fund to resume lending to the country. The drop comes a day after foreign exchange companies removed a cap on the exchange rate, a key demand of the IMF as part of a program of economic reforms it has agreed on with the cash-strapped South Asian nation. The currency's official value closed at 255.4 rupees against the dollar versus 230.9 on Wednesday, the central bank said. Facing an acute balance of payments crisis, Pakistan is desperate to secure external financing, with less than three weeks' worth of import cover in its foreign exchange reserves, which fell $923 million to $3.68 billion in the latest data. Pakistan secured a $6 billion IMF bailout in 2019. It was topped up with another $1 billion last year to help the country following devastating floods, but the IMF then suspended disbursements in November due to Pakistan's failure to make more progress on fiscal consolidation. The lender announced on Thursday that it was sending a mission to the country at the end of January to discuss resuming the program. Aside from wanting the government to take fiscal measures, the IMF is pushing for it to move to a market-determined exchange rate regime, which the IMF highlighted in its statement on Thursday. 'Artificial' distortions The foreign exchange companies said on Wednesday that they had removed the cap for the sake of the country, because it was causing ""artificial"" distortions for the economy. Wednesday's move by foreign currency dealers, whose open market rates are different from the rate notified by the central bank, had a cascade effect on official exchange rates on Thursday. The drop in the official rate was the biggest since 1999 in both absolute and percentage terms, according to JS Global, a Pakistani brokerage house. In the open market, the rupee weakened from 243 rupees to the dollar to 262, a drop of about 7%, having lost 1.2% the previous day, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) trade data. ""We requested the central bank to increase the interbank (rate) to help combat the black market,"" ECAP President Malik Bostan told Reuters. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the finance ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Attempts by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to defend the rupee since his appointment in September, including reported currency market interventions, had run counter to the IMF's advice. Positive response The Pakistan Stock Exchange, however, reacted positively to the rupee's fall, with the KSE 100 index shooting up more than 1,000 points, or 2.5%. ""The depreciation in the rupee takes away some uncertainty regarding the economic roadmap ahead and resumption of the IMF program, which the market is responding positively to,"" Tahir Abbass, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, said. Topline Securities, a Karachi-based brokerage house, said the sharp fall in foreign exchange reserves from $8 billion in September to $4.6 billion as of Jan. 13 led to a widening in the spread between the official and open market rates, and created a black market for dollars due to the low supply. The sudden drop in rates hit banks hard. According to two officials in commercial banks operating in Pakistan, banks that had earlier borrowed at 230 rupees to the dollar to make payments by running open positions now have to settle payments at a rate of 250 rupees. The officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity that banks that were hit the hardest are those that did not have adequate dollar inflows. Decades-high inflation While the move increases the chances of a restart in IMF funding, Pakistan is also reeling from decades-high inflation, which economists fear will now get worse. Most of Pakistan's critical imports, including fuel, are paid for in dollars. ""It will give a significant impetus to already elevated price pressures in the economy,"" said Sakib Sherani, a Pakistani macroeconomist, adding that consumer price index (CPI) numbers are heading to levels previously unseen in the country. In the first half of the current financial year, which ends in June, average inflation has been 25%. The central bank is also tightening monetary policy sharply, with key rates also at decades-high levels and growth having come to a grinding halt. The ensuing economic crisis will also pile political pressure on the government, with former prime minister Imran Khan demanding a snap general election."
TikTok CEO to testify before Congress in March,"Jan 31, 2023","TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will testify at an upcoming hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a committee spokesperson confirmed to CNN Monday. Chew will be the sole witness at the hearing, scheduled for March 23. He is expected to testify on TikTok's privacy and data security practices, its impact on young users, and its ""relationship to the Chinese Communist Party,"" according to a hearing announcement on the committee's website. ""We've made our concerns clear with TikTok,"" said the committee's chair, Washington Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, in a statement. ""It is now time to continue the committee's efforts to hold Big Tech accountable by bringing TikTok before the committee to provide complete and honest answers for people."" Chew's upcoming testimony was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. ""We welcome the opportunity to set the record straight about TikTok, ByteDance, and the commitments we are making to address concerns about U.S. national security before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce,"" Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in a statement. ""We hope that by sharing details of our comprehensive plans with the full Committee, Congress can take a more deliberative approach to the issues at hand."" The high-profile hearing underscores the rising political risk for TikTok as its negotiations with the US government on a national security deal continue to drag on. US officials have raised concerns that China could use its laws to pressure TikTok or its parent, ByteDance, to hand over US user data that could be used for intelligence or disinformation purposes. Those concerns have prompted the US government to ban TikTok from official devices, and more than half of US states have taken similar measures, according to a CNN analysis. Chew, who took over as TikTok CEO in April 2021, has largely stayed out of the spotlight at a time when the app he leads can't seem to avoid it. Members of Congress previously grilled TikTok COO Vanessa Pappas, arguably the public face of the company in the United States, during a Senate hearing last year."
Why a tiny American firm is taking aim at an Indian conglomerate,"Jan 31, 2023","Asia's richest man is in the crosshairs of a research firm whose very name evokes panic. Hindenburg Research — named after the 1937 airship disaster — is a relatively young, small New York financial researcher known for taking bold bets against high-flying corporations that it believes are overvalued, fraudulent, or both. Last week, Hindenburg stunned investors when it released a report based on what it said was a two-year investigation into the Adani Group, one of India's largest multinational conglomerates. The report and the selloff it sparked — erasing some $70 billion in market value across Adani Group companies — is renewing concerns about the group's corporate governance, as well as stoking debate about the often-chaotic role short-sellers like Hindenburg play in financial markets. Who is Adani, and what is he accused of? Gautam Adani is a 60-year-old tycoon who founded the Adani Group over 30 years ago, building it into India's largest port operator, with businesses spanning infrastructure and energy production. He became India's richest man a year ago, and briefly surpassed Jeff Bezos to become the world's second-wealthiest. The Hindenburg report, which the Adani Group dismissed as baseless, accuses the conglomerate and Adani himself of pulling off ""the largest con in corporate history."" Hindenburg accused the company of ""brazen stock manipulation"" and accounting fraud that's taken place over decades. Hindenburg said Adani Group shares are massively overvalued, and it has taken a short position (more on that in a minute) on them, meaning Hindenburg wins when Adani shares fall. The Adani Group shot back, calling the Hindenburg report ""nothing but a lie."" In a more than 400-page rebuttal, the Adani Group said Hindenburg's shorting of overseas-traded bonds and derivatives amounted to securities fraud, and that the report was an attack on India. In a rebuttal of that rebuttal, Hindenburg said ""fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism,"" and that the Adani Group had ignored ""every key allegation we raised."" Adani's defenses and denials of wrongdoing haven't been enough to stem the bleeding. Since the release of Hindenburg's report last week, the group has lost more than $70 billion of its stock market value, my colleague Diksha Madhok reports. Adani's own personal net worth has also plummeted by some $30 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, though he remains the among the wealthiest people on the planet, with $92 billion to his name. What is short-selling? In its most basic form, short-selling is an investing tactic premised on a stock (or other security) losing value. To put it in non-financial terms: Let's say there's a football game on Friday night, and your friend has a ticket. But you suspect the price of tickets may fall due to lack of demand on game day. So you borrow the ticket from your friend, for a small fee, and promise to have it back to them in time for kickoff. Right away, you sell the ticket you borrowed for 50 bucks, betting that by game day the cost of a ticket will be less than $50. And sure enough, bad weather keeps people at home and the stadium starts slashing prices. You buy a ticket for $30, give it to your friend, and pocket the $20 difference (minus whatever fee you paid your friend for the privilege of borrowing.) In practice, firms that specialize in short-selling are often among the most reviled. If the world of Wall Street is a craps table, where one player's winnings boost everyone else's, short-sellers are the guys betting against the table. Short-sellers argue that their work plays an important watchdog role, exposing fraud and keeping assets from becoming over-inflated. ""Critical, adversarial research is needed because Wall Street is a finely tuned machine, built to sell securities to the public, regardless of quality,"" Hindenburg wrote in a 2021 report. ""The corporate world is rife with fraud, and investors have little protection."" And to their credit, short sellers were key to exposing major market frauds like Enron in 2001 and the systemic mortgage fraud that nearly cratered the global economy in 2008. Of course, there's nothing to stop bad actors in the short-selling world from making exaggerated or bogus claims about a company to try to turn a quick profit. What is Hindenburg Research? Hindenburg is a short-seller that specializes in forensic financial research, founded in 2017 by Nathan Anderson. And yes, it is named after the Hindenburg: ""We view the Hindenburg as the epitome of a totally man-made, totally avoidable disaster,"" its website states. ""We look for similar man-made disasters floating around in the market and aim to shed light on them before they lure in more unsuspecting victims."" It's sort of like a bunch of investigative journalists, except without all the ethical baggage. (Journalists cannot retain a financial interest in their subjects; short-sellers like Hindenburg almost always do.) Hindenburg won its reputation as a bloodhound for financial malfeasance in 2020, when it accused electric vehicle maker Nikola of lying to investors about its truck's capabilities. Nikola's founder was eventually convicted of fraud. What happens next? Adani Group's top lawyer said the company was considering legal action against Hindenburg. In response, Hindenburg tweeted that it would welcome such action and that it stands by its report. Meanwhile, the negative press comes at a tricky time for Adani, who is aiming to raise $2.5 billion by issuing new shares in Adani Enterprises this month. The offer will close on Tuesday.

Consumers say they're feeling better about the economy. But they're still planning for a recession,"Jan 28, 2023","For the second month in a row, consumers said they are feeling better about the economy. The University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index measured 64.9 for January, according to data released Friday. That's up slightly from the preliminary reading of 64.6 earlier this month and 9% higher than December's final reading. But it's still historically low: The index measured 101 in February 2020, and it had an average reading of 86 between that date and the first-ever reading in November 1952. A separate report released earlier on Friday showed that consumers cut back on their spending in December and started stashing more in their savings as they prepare for a potential recession. That caution was also reflected in the Michigan surveys. ""There are considerable downside risks to sentiment, with two-thirds of consumers expecting an economic downturn during the next year,"" said Joanne Hsu, director of the university's Surveys of Consumers. ""Notably, the debt ceiling debate looms ahead and could reverse the gains seen over the last several months; past debt ceiling crises in 2011 and 2013 prompted steep declines in consumer confidence."" Year-ahead inflation expectations declined for the fourth consecutive month, falling to 3.9% in January from 4.4% in December. Long-run inflation expectations held at 2.9%, according to the report. It has been hovering at around 3% for the past year and a half. ""Consumers continued to exhibit considerable uncertainty over both long- and short-term inflation expectations, indicating the tentative nature of any declines,"" Hsu said in comments accompanying the report."

LVMH cheers the 'spectacular' return of Chinese tourists,"Jan 27, 2023","LVMH posted record results Thursday, and expressed confidence that China's luxury market would bounce back this year as the country continues to reopen. The world's biggest luxury group logged revenue of €79.2 billion ($86.2 billion) and profit of €21.1 billion ($22.9 billion) for 2022, both up 23%. In a presentation, the company said it was buoyed by the recovery of international travel and strong demand from local customers across Europe, the United States and Japan. And in the coming months, ""we have every reason to [be] confident, indeed optimistic, on the Chinese market,"" LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said on a conference call. ""There are green shoots in China,"" he told analysts. ""In Macao, where Chinese can now travel to, the change is quite spectacular. Stores are full. It's really come back [at a] very strong pace."" The owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Sephora also has various stores in France that are ready to welcome Chinese shoppers as more travel restrictions are rolled back, Arnault said. He predicted, though, that Chinese tourists would not return in large numbers until at least the second half of the year. China lifted some of the world's toughest Covid-19 border restrictions this month after nearly three years, scrapping a quarantine requirement for international travelers. Arnault noted that while LVMH was seeing signs of recovery, it was still ""early days."" ""We can't guarantee it's going to continue like that,"" he said. ""[But] if it continues as it is, it will be an excellent year."" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony also cautioned that the current level of customer traffic in China was still about 40% below pre-pandemic levels, and that the economic outlook was tough to predict. But in another sign of optimism, LVMH proposed to hike its 2022 dividend on Thursday, from 10 euros to 12 euros per share. The proposal will be up for approval at the company's general meeting in April. LVMH is the latest luxury giant to deliver an upbeat forecast over China's reopening. Last week, Swatch Group, the owner of Omega and Harry Winston, predicted ""a record year in 2023,"" based on strong sales growth it had already seen this month in China. ""After the end of Covid measures, consumption quickly recovered, not only in China,"" but also in the nearby cities of Hong Kong and Macao, the Swiss watchmaker said in a statement. The removal of Chinese travel restrictions will likely also boost sales in overseas tourist destinations, the company added. Burberry, too, has pointed to signs of ""a good recovery"" in China this month, following a slump caused by the country's Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in the last quarter. Sales in mainland China fell 23% in the three months ended December, the British brand said whilst reporting earnings last week. ""While the timing and pace of recovery remains uncertain for the rest of this year, we are confident in the opportunity and the long term prospects of the Chinese market,"" Julie Brown, the company's chief operating and financial officer, told analysts."
Here's why you should always wait for the earnings call,"Jan 30, 2023","Investors are pretty bad at living in the moment. We're currently in the thick of fourth quarter earnings reports, but traders don't seem to care about how companies fared during the final months of 2022. They're more focused on what's going to happen in the future. Case-in-point: Earnings calls, where top execs pontificate about their economic outlook, have been moving markets more than earnings-per-share and revenue reports. What's happening: The mantra on Wall Street has become, as Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown puts it, ""ignore the numbers, wait for the call."" Microsoft reported great fourth quarter earnings last Tuesday that beat Wall Street's expectations, but the stock dropped 4% the next day. That's because CEO Satya Nadella got on an earnings call with investors and warned of a slowdown in the company's cloud business and software sales. His negative outlook came just as the company announced it was letting go of 10,000 employees, further spooking investors.  Other tech companies are following suit — while things are fine for the time being, they're reporting that the future is foggy. IBM stock sank 4.5% last Thursday even as the tech titan beat Wall Street's Q4 expectations. The reason for the drop might be because Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's finance chief, warned on the conference call that it would be wise to expect the company's total 2023 revenue growth to be on the low end. IBM also announced layoffs -- the company said it plans to cut around 3,900 jobs or 1.5% of its total workforce.  The economic environment is rapidly changing. CEOs on earnings calls are talking more about recession than inflation now, according to an analysis by Purpose Investments. Wall Street is also beginning to fear an economic downturn more than painful rate hikes and as a result investors are putting more weight on CEO and CFO forecasts. And they're looking bleak. As of Friday, 19 companies in the S&P 500 had issued forward earnings-per-share guidance for the first quarter of 2023, according to FactSet data. Of these 19 companies, 17, or 89%, issued negative guidance. That's well above the 5-year average of 59%. ""My best guess is that cautious tones on conference calls will be the norm, not the exception,"" wrote Brown in a recent post. These slowdowns have been partially factored into stock prices, he said, ""but not necessarily in full."" The upside: Market reaction appears to go both ways. American Express missed on earnings last week but said that credit card spending was hitting new records and that the future looks bright. The stock shot up more than 10%.  Gas prices are surging this month. Here's why Prices at the pump typically fall during the coldest months as wintry weather keeps Americans off the roads. But something unusual is happening this year, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Gas prices are rocketing higher. The national average for regular gas jumped to $3.51 a gallon on Friday and remained there through the weekend, according to AAA. Although that's a far cry from the record of $5.02 a gallon last June, gas prices have increased by 12 cents in the past week and 41 cents in the past month. All told, the national average has climbed by more than 9% since the end of last year -- the biggest increase to start a year since 2009, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Why are gas prices jumping? It's not because of demand, which remains weak, even for this time of the year. Instead, the problem is supply. The extreme weather in much of the United States near the end of last year caused a series of outages at the refineries that produce the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel that keep the economy humming. US refineries are operating at just 86% of capacity, down from the mid-90% range at the start of December, according to Bespoke. Beyond the refinery problems, oil prices have crept higher, helping to drive prices at the pump northward. US oil prices have jumped about 16% since December partially due to expectations of higher worldwide demand as China relaxes its Covid-19 policies and also because oil markets are no longer receiving massive injections of emergency barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What's next: Expect more pain at the pump. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, worries the typical springtime jump in prices will be pulled forward. ""Instead of $4 a gallon happening in May, it could happen as early as March,"" De Haan told CNN. ""There is more upside risk than downside risk."" A return of $4 gas would be painful to drivers and could dent consumer confidence. Moreover, pain at the pump would complicate the inflation picture as the Federal Reserve debates whether to slow its interest rate hiking campaign. Goldman Sachs CEO gets a 30% pay cut -- but still makes $25 million Goldman Sachs had a rough time in 2022, and the investment bank's CEO, David Solomon, is being punished for it. Well, kind of.  The investment banking giant said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday that Solomon received $25 million in annual compensation last year. While that is still a very large amount of money, it's down nearly 30% from the $35 million that Solomon raked in during 2021, reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica.  Solomon's $2 million annual salary is unchanged. But the company said that his ""annual variable compensation,"" paid in a mix of performance-based restricted stock units and cash, was well below 2021 levels. Goldman Sachs (GS) shares fell more than 10% in 2022. The company also  reported a 16% drop in revenue in the fourth quarter and profit plunge of 66% earlier this month, mainly due to the lack of merger activity and initial public offerings. Maybe Solomon can make that extra $10 million with payouts from his burgeoning DJ career. "
Bill Gates says he shouldn't have had dinners with Jeffrey Epstein,"Jan 31, 2023","Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he ""shouldn't have had dinners"" with Jeffrey Epstein during an interview with Australia's ABC 7 .30. Gates and Epstein, the powerful financier who was accused of child sex trafficking before dying, of an apparent suicide, in a New York City jail cell while awaiting trial, had met numerous times beginning in 2011, according to a New York Times report. But Gates had told CNN he only had dinners with him for potential philanthropic opportunities. Epstein plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 -- well before Gates' meetings with him. Presenter Sarah Ferguson grilled Gates, asking if he ""regrets the relationship he maintained"" with Epstein, going against his ex-wife Melinda Gates' advice. ""You're going way back in time,"" Gates said, adding he's said this ""over the hundredth time."" ""I shouldn't have had dinners with him,"" Gates responded. Ferguson asked if Melinda was warning Gates about Epstein's ""way of sexually compromising people."" ""No,"" Gates said, and he repeated that he regrets ""having dinner with him."" He also denied there was a relationship of any kind between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Epstein. Gates made similar comments to CNN in August 2021. ""It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there,"" Gates said to Anderson Cooper. Gates said in the CNN interview he met with Epstein to raise more money to deal with global health issues. ""I had several dinners with him, you know, hoping that what he said about getting billions of philanthropy for global health through contacts that he had might emerge,"" Gates said. ""When it looked like that wasn't a real thing, that relationship ended."" New York federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal indictment against Epstein in July 2019, alleging the wealthy financial manager operated a sex trafficking ring where he sexually abused dozens of underage girls. These allegations had followed Epstein for years. Epstein was found dead in his New York jail cell in August 2019; the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said his cause of death was suicide by hanging. Gates made similar statements to the to the Wall Street Journal, when it reported that his social connection to Epstein played a role in his divorce from Melinda French Gates. ""It's a time of reflection, and at this point, I need to go forward,"" Gates told CNN in 2021. ""Within the family, we'll heal the best that we can."" -- CNN's Andy Rose contributed to this story."
China's reopening isn't all good news. Inflation could get a second wind,"Jan 28, 2023","China's swift reopening after nearly three years of strict coronavirus controls could provide a much-needed boost to global economic growth, but may also stoke inflation just as it has shown signs of falling back. The revival of the world's second largest economy — and its biggest consumer of commodities — threatens to push up global prices for fuel, industrial metals and food this year. Since the beginning of January, prices for copper, aluminum and zinc have all had their best start to a year in 11 years, rallying by an average of 13%, analysts at Deutsche Bank told CNN, citing data from the London Metal Exchange. Tin, which is largely used to make electronics, has soared 30%, its biggest rise in 32 years. ""There's a tremendous amount of pent-up demand that we do expect to come back to markets, specifically after Chinese New Year,"" Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at precious metals trader MKS Pamp, told CNN. ""Markets have rallied in anticipation of that,"" she said. It's not just commodities that are rising on hopes for China's recovery. Stocks in MSCI's China index have risen 14% since the start of trading this year. Nasdaq's Golden Dragon China index — which tracks Chinese companies listed in the United States — have climbed 19% over the same period. There already signs that the economy is getting back on its feet. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of luxury retail group LVMH, told analysts on Thursday that the rebound in visitors to stores in Macao, where Chinese tourists are now allowed to travel, had been ""spectacular."" Since last month, the Chinese government has been rapidly dismantling its strict zero-Covid policy following a wave of popular protests over the restrictions. The speed of the reopening, as well as indications that infections may have already peaked, has been surprising, analysts told CNN. But metals like copper and aluminum are ""not a very meaningful part of the overall inflation basket,"" Daniel Major, metals and mining analyst at UBS, told CNN. Yet, if global food and energy prices start rising again, that could feed through into higher consumer prices. China's reopening could bump up demand for agricultural goods, while the world is still in the grips of the worst food crisis in modern history. Futures prices for wheat, a dietary staple, are still 58% higher than they were in mid-2020, when prices started to rise steadily. Chinese imports of soybeans, which its uses mostly to feed livestock, soared by 18% in December from the year before, possibly because buyers anticipated a rebound in demand at restaurants, Bill Weatherburn, a commodities economist at Capital Economics, said in a note earlier this month. A surge in energy demand China's reopening is also expected to drive up demand for oil. The International Energy Agency said in a report last week that global demand could surge to an all-time high of 101.7 million barrels per day this year, with China accounting for almost half of that increase. Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, told CNN that she expects oil prices to rise later this year as travel and consumption pick up. The research group now expects the price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, to rise to $95 a barrel by the end of the year, up from its previous estimate of $85. US gas prices have already climbed 40 cents a gallon in a month, partly because of the rise in crude prices since early December. Rising oil prices could help push up global inflation — or at least keep it elevated — just when consumer price rises have shown signs of moderating, tempering hopes by businesses and investors that the world's central banks may soon be done raising interest rates. Markets expect the US Federal Reserve to hike the cost of borrowing by 25 basis points at its meeting next week, a more modest increase than the 50 basis point raise it approved last month. China's appetite for energy could prove especially difficult for Europe as the continent tries to refill its natural gas stores ahead of next winter with just a tiny fraction of the Russian imports it once relied on. Europe's benchmark natural gas prices have tumbled 84% since hitting their all-time high of €343 ($373) per megawatt hours in August. That trend could start to reverse if China competes with Europe for a fixed number of LNG cargoes from the United States and Qatar, the bloc's biggest suppliers. ""The amount of LNG that [China] will be buying from the rest of the world will be higher than we have seen,"" Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, told a panel at the World Economic Forum last week. ""There will be more inflationary pressure coming out of that added demand in commodities, and energy in particular,"" she said, adding that the ECB plans to ""stay the course"" in raising interest rates to help tame inflation. Too much hype? Expectations of huge price jumps across the board may be overblown, however. Demand for steel won't pick up until the latter half of the year, according to Bain, as activity in China's struggling property sector, which is a big consumer of the metal, is still depressed. ""I'm not convinced that demand out of China is going to drive prices [of gas and electricity] up by as much as people perhaps think they will,"" Michael Hewsom, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN. Hewsom added that China and India could import Russian natural gas at a discount, freeing up cargoes from other suppliers such as the United States to go to Europe. A surge in Chinese demand for energy, metals and food is also likely ""to be partially offset by weak demand for Chinese manufactured goods exports in developed economies,"" Capital Economics said in a note earlier this month. China's rebound is likely to be driven by ""leisure [and] domestic consumption,"" UBS's Major said. That means prices for steel and iron ore — metals commonly used in heavy industry — are less likely to see big gains compared to copper and aluminum, which are found in a range of domestic goods. Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics, said in a Friday note that any rise in global inflation on the back of China's revival may be ""smaller than many people fear."" That's partly because China is reopening on its own, he added, unlike the United States and Europe, which unwound their pandemic restrictions at roughly the same time, creating heightened competition for goods. — Michelle Toh, Philip Wang and Julia Horowitz contributed reporting."
Pending home sales increased last month for the first time since May,"Jan 28, 2023","Pending home sales increased in December for the first time since May, a sign that lower mortgage rates are bringing some buyers back into the housing market. The pending sales index, based on signed contracts to buy a home rather than the final sales that are accounted for in existing home sales, improved by 2.5% from November to December, according to data released Friday from the National Association of Realtors. However, that's down by 33.8% from the frenzied market of a year ago. ""This recent low point in home sales activity is likely over,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. ""Mortgage rates are the dominant factor driving home sales, and recent declines in rates are clearly helping to stabilize the market."" Not all regions saw the same levels of activity, however. Pending sales dropped in the Northeast, where the index was down 6.5% in December from November; and in the Midwest, where the index was down 0.3%. The national turnaround was largely fueled by upticks in the West and the South. Pending sales were up 6.1% in the South in December from November and rose 6.4% in the West. While economic uncertainty remains, cooling inflation and a resilient job market have many in the housing industry feeling optimistic that home-buying levels could improve as mortgage rates stabilize. ""The new normal for mortgage rates will likely be in the 5.5% to 6.5% range,"" Yun predicted. ""Job gains will steadily become important in driving local home-sales markets. The South, in particular, is set to outperform the rest of the country, thanks primarily to better job market conditions in this part of the country."" 'Buyers are out there' Multiple leading indicators in housing are pointing to modestly higher sales activity, said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American. ""Mortgage applications have been trending higher alongside lower rates, pending home sales are up, and builder confidence increased in January,"" Kushi said. ""Interested buyers are out there. From a financial perspective, the decision to buy a home comes down to a payment-to-paycheck calculation, and lower rates may help to reduce the mortgage payment while higher incomes can increase one's monthly paycheck."" But affordability will remain a challenge for many, since housing demand remains frozen by high prices and mortgage rates, said Hannah Jones, economic data analyst at Realtor.com. ""Though mortgage rates fell as low as 6.27% in December, down 0.8 percentage points from November's high, home prices remained elevated, up 8.4% compared to the previous year,"" she said. To many buyers' relief, mortgage rates have continued to fall since December. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is currently 6.13%, a level not seen since September, according to data from Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate was 3.55%. Mortgage rates have trended downward since early November, and housing affordability improved in December. The national median mortgage payment decreased last month to $1,920, down 2.9% from $1,977 in November, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This trend appears to be continuing in the new year as buyers have been taking advantage of the relatively lower rates of the past few weeks. Another positive signal: Applications for mortgages were up 7% last week from one week earlier, according to MBA. Yet even with December's improvement in affordability, mortgage rates were still nearly double what they were in the year before. That means the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home was $730 higher in December than in December 2021, according to Realtor.com. ""As a result, many buyers remain on the sidelines, waiting for conditions to improve,"" said Jones. Home inventory remains stubbornly low as homeowners are reluctant to part with their ultra-low mortgage rate for much higher current rates. This is keeping prices elevated, especially as an appetite to buy returns. ""The ongoing lack of affordability has limited buyer activity this winter, but this month's retreat in mortgage rate has shown how eager buyers are to get back into the market,"" said Jones. ""Lower interest rates and the coming spring homebuying season promise more opportunities for buyers and sellers alike."""
"Jan. 6 Committee failed to hold social media companies to account for their role in the Capitol attack, staffers and witnesses say","Jan 27, 2023","""There might be someone getting shot tomorrow."" That was the warning from Twitter staff at an internal meeting on Jan. 5, 2021, the eve of the deadly attack on the US Capitol. It wasn't the only stark warning Twitter management received ahead of the insurrection, according to two former Twitter employees who spoke to the House Jan. 6 Committee. But now these witnesses, along with some committee staff, are frustrated, saying the committee failed to adequately hold major social media companies to account for the role they played in the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years. It was a ""real missed opportunity,"" Anika Collier Navaroli, a former Twitter employee turned whistleblower who gave evidence to the committee, told CNN in an interview last week. ""I risked a lot to come forward and speak to the committee and to share the truth about these momentous occasions in history,"" Navaroli said. CNN spoke to half a dozen people who interacted with and were familiar with the Jan. 6 Committee's so-called ""purple team"" -- a group that included staff with expertise in extremism and online misinformation. Some witnesses and staff said the committee pulled its punches when it came to Big Tech, failing to include critical parts of the team's work in its final report. The discontent has poured into public view, with an unpublished draft of the team's findings leaked and obtained by multiple news organizations, including CNN. One source familiar with the probe acknowledged that the committee obtained evidence that social media companies like Twitter largely ignored concerns that were raised internally prior to Jan. 6, but while those platforms should have done something at the time, the panel was limited in its ability to hold them accountable. A lawyer who worked on the committee said the panel did its job and focused on the unique and malign role of then-President Donald Trump in an unprecedented attack on American democracy. They also said the final report outlines structural issues across social media and society that need to be studied further. Disagreement about social media companies' role in the Jan. 6 attack comes as 2023 looks to be a pivotal year for Silicon Valley firms in Washington, DC. Spurred in part by the release of Elon Musk's so-called ""Twitter Files,"" House Republicans are set to investigate purported Big Tech censorship, particularly as it pertains to social media companies' handling of a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden and his laptop. Facebook parent company Meta's high-stakes decision Wednesday to reinstate Trump on its platforms is also expected to stoke further scrutiny of tech companies' influence in elections. At the Supreme Court, justices are set to rule this year on a case that could strip key protections afforded to tech companies moderating online speech. A missed opportunity It isn't just Navaroli who has taken issue with the committee's findings. Three of the committee's own staff members, part of the so-called purple team, published an article earlier this month, sharply criticizing the decisions made by social media companies in the lead up to the attack. The final report's ""emphasis on Trump meant important context was left on the cutting room floor,"" they wrote. ""Indeed, the lack of an official Committee report chapter or appendix dedicated exclusively to these matters does not mean our investigation exonerated social media companies for their failure to confront violent rhetoric,"" they wrote. In wake of the decision, CNN has reviewed thousands of pages of deposition transcripts and other supporting documents the committee has publicly released that provide insight into Silicon Valley's action and inaction in the critical period between Election Day 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021. Navaroli, who worked on Twitter's safety policy team, told the committee she had repeatedly warned Twitter's leadership in the lead-up to Jan. 6 about the dangers of not cracking down on what she said was violent rhetoric. Navaroli pointed to Trump's infamous ""stand back and stand by"" message to the Proud Boys at the first 2020 presidential debate as one instance that incited more violent rhetoric on Twitter. Navaroli initially appeared before the committee as an anonymous whistleblower. Part of her testimony was played during the public committee hearings last summer, with her voice distorted to protect her identity. However, she later decided to go public, testifying before the committee for a second time, and speaking to The Washington Post. In an interview with CNN, Navaroli said she is speaking out now because she believes it is important for the ""truth to be on the record."" She warned that without a full reckoning of social media's role in the Capitol attack, political violence could once again ignite in the United States and elsewhere around the world, pointing to recent unrest in Brazil where supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the country's top government offices. A leak The final report from the Jan. 6 Committee stated, ""Social media played a prominent role in amplifying erroneous claims of election fraud."" But a far more blistering assessment was laid out in an unpublished draft document prepared by committee staff that was obtained by several news organizations, including CNN. Its key findings included: ""Social media platforms delayed response to the rise of far-right extremism—and President Trump's incitement of his supporters—helped to facilitate the attack on January 6th."" ""Fear of reprisal and accusations of censorship from the political right compromised policy, process, and decision-making."" ""Twitter failed to take actions that could have prevented the spread of incitement to violence after the election."" ""Facebook did not fail to grapple with election delegitimization after the election so much as it did not even try."" Tech companies would broadly dispute these findings and have repeatedly said they are working to keep their platforms safe. Twitter's previous management repeatedly outlined steps it said it was taking to crack down on hateful and violent rhetoric on its platform prior to Jan. 6, 2021, but stressed it didn't want to unnecessarily limit free expression. Under Musk's leadership, Twitter no longer has a responsive communications team, and the company did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, pointed to an earlier statement from the company where it said it was cooperating with the committee. Jacob Glick, an investigative counsel who conducted multiple depositions for the Jan. 6 Committee, including Navaroli's, told CNN he believes the committee did its job to show ""the American public the dangers posed by President Trump's multilayered attack on our democracy."" He said the lack of awareness he believes tech companies have shown about their role in the attack was ""stark."" ""I don't think social media companies recognize they were dealing with a sustained threat to American democracy,"" he said. Glick, who now works at the Georgetown Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, said the purple team's report had not been fact-checked, contains some errors, and should not have been leaked. Another source familiar with the committee's work told CNN, ""It couldn't be clearer that Trump was at the center of this plot to overturn the election. Not everything staff worked on could fit into this extensive report and hearings, including some who wanted their work to be the center of the investigation."" Culture wars and content moderation How social media platforms write and enforce their rules has become a central and ongoing debate, raising the key question of what power the companies should wield when it comes to politicians like Trump. While some, including Navaroli, insist Trump repeatedly broke social media platforms' rules by inciting violent rhetoric that should have resulted in his removal before Jan. 6, others including Musk and Twitter's previous management, argue that what politicians say should be made available to as many people as possible so they can be held to account. Meta and Twitter have both reversed their bans on Trump. ""We're moving backwards and it's concerning to me,"" Navaroli said of the return of prominent election conspiracy theorists to major tech platforms. ""History has taught us what happens when political speech on social media companies is allowed to fester unchecked."""
"Norway discovers huge trove of metals, minerals and rare earths on its seabed","Jan 30, 2023","A Norwegian study has found a ""substantial"" amount of metals and minerals ranging from copper to rare earths on the seabed of its extended continental shelf, authorities said on Friday in their first official estimates. These resources are in high demand for the role they play in the transition to a greener economy. The Nordic country, a major oil and gas exporter, is considering whether to open its offshore areas to deep-sea mining, a process that requires parliament's approval and has sparked environmental concerns. ""Of the metals found on the seabed in the study area, magnesium, niobium, cobalt and rare earth minerals are found on the European Commission's list of critical minerals,"" the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which conducted the study, said in a statement. The resources estimate, covering remote areas in the Norwegian Sea and Greenland Sea, showed there were 38 million tonnes of copper, almost twice the volume mined globally each year, and 45 million tonnes of zinc accumulated in polymetallic sulphides. The sulphides, or ""black smokers,"" are found along the mid-ocean ridge, where magma from the Earth's mantle reaches the sea floor, at depths of around 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). About 24 million tonnes of magnesium and 3.1 million tonnes of cobalt are estimated to be in manganese crusts grown on bedrock over millions of years, as well as 1.7 million tonnes of cerium, a rare earth element used in alloys. The manganese crusts are also estimated to contain other rare earth metals, such as neodymium, yttrium and dysprosium. ""Costly, rare minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium are extremely important for magnets in wind turbines and the engines in electric vehicles,"" the NPD said. Environmental groups have called on Norway to postpone its seabed mineral exploration until more studies are conducted to understand the organisms living on the seabed and the impact of mining on them. There is ""a great lack of knowledge"" of deep oceans, where new and undiscovered species are potentially to be found, Norway's Institute of Marine Research said in a consultation letter. The International Seabed Authority, the UN-affiliated body that oversees the deep-sea mining sector, is expected to announce regulations for the nascent industry in July. Many scientists have warned that mining the deep sea could have huge and irreversible implications for the fragile ecosystem. The NPD said its estimates showed resources ""in place,"" and further studies were needed to establish how much of those could be recovered with acceptable environmental impact. The Norwegian find follows the announcement in January by Swedish mining company LKAB that it had found Europe's largest deposit of rare earth oxides in the country's far north. The market for rare earths is dominated by China, none are currently mined in Europe leaving it dependent on imports. ""This is good news, not only for LKAB, the region and the Swedish people, but also for Europe and the climate,"" said Jan Moström, president and group CEO of LKAB, said in a statement."
From worst to first: 2022's stock losers are leading the market this year,"Jan 31, 2023","Stocks ended Monday lower following a solid rally last week. Investors may have jitters ahead of this week's big Federal Reserve meeting, a deluge of earnings from top tech firms and the jobs report on Friday. The Dow fell more than 260 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slid 1.3% and 2%. Still, it's still been a solid start to the year for the market — and many of last year's losers have led the way on Wall Street so far in January. The communications sector, with its many hard-hit tech and media companies, is the best performing market group so far in 2023: It has surged nearly 10%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It was the worst-performing sector in 2022, plummeting 40%. CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, which plunged nearly 60% last year, has surged more than 50% so far in 2023 and is the best performer in the S&P 500. Several other media companies, old and new, have also enjoyed a resurgence this month. CBS owner Paramount has soared 35%. Disney is up about 25%. Netflix has gained more than 20%. (So much for the death of streaming media?) Shares of Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms are up more than 20%, as well. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include many retailers and auto companies, have also enjoyed a stunning rebound after tumbling last year. The sector was the second-worst performer in 2022 with a loss of about 38%. Just look at Tesla. Elon Musk's electric vehicle giant is up more than 35%. It too had a miserable 2022, losing nearly two-thirds of its value last year. Investors seem to be buying into hopes the Fed will continue pulling back on the size of its rate hikes after several historically large increases last year and possibly even pause later this year. Increasingly, the sentiment is that the economy could wind up heading for a so-called soft landing: a slowdown but not a full-blown recession. Those hopes have boosted other consumer stocks. Amazon is up about 20% this year. Cruise line owners Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian are among the top performers in the S&P 500. So are shares of casino companies Caesars, Wynn, Las Vegas Sands and MGM. Rising market tide lifting questionable boats Still, some investors are worried this year's market rally is eerily reminiscent of prior market bubbles. That's because it's not just quality companies that are gaining. The resurgence is also clear in meme stocks. GameStop is up nearly 15%. Movie theater chain AMC has soared about 25%. Crypto brokerage firm Coinbase has skyrocketed nearly 60%, despite the collapse of rival FTX and Coinbase's own announcement of massive layoffs. Coinbase has been boosted by a rebound in bitcoin prices. Then there are companies like Bed Bath & Beyond and Carvana, both of which have enjoyed solid gains this year even though there are rumors of potential bankruptcy filings. Even if these companies avoid Chapter 11, it's clear that they are financially distressed. ""We have seen speculation return to the forefront,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist with Interactive Brokers, in a recent report. Sosnick, not mincing words, has dubbed the rally in these types of companies a ""flight to crap."" Others worry that if the stock market remains this frothy, it will push the Fed to keep raising rates far more aggressively than investors expect: ""The January melt-up in stocks will not last and the more exuberant the market gets, the more likely the Fed will be more aggressive with rate hikes,"" said David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs, an investment research firm, in a report. ""Most investors don't realize the Fed has to fight the inflation in the stock market, too,"" Trainer added. ""That means investors need to buy stocks with good fundamentals and real cash flows and sell the profitless, narrative-driven stocks that have dominated headlines over the past few years."""
"We finally know whom FTX owes money to: Wall Street elite, Big Tech, airlines, and many more","Jan 27, 2023","Newly unsealed bankruptcy documents revealed thousands of creditors to whom FTX owes money after the once-mighty crypto exchange collapsed in November. Wall Street heavyweights including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan were named in the creditor list, which includes businesses, charities, individuals and other entities in a 116-page document filed late Wednesday. FTX is now at the center of a massive fraud investigation. Also included in the creditors list are media companies, such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, commercial airliners, including American, United, Southwest and Spirit, as well as several Big Tech players, including Netflix, Apple and Meta. On Thursday, lawyers for FTX filed an additional document advising the court that the list — known as a creditor matrix — is ""intended to be very broad"" and ""includes parties who may appear in the Debtors books and records for any number of reasons."" Being on the list does not ""necessarily indicate that the party is a creditor"" of FTX or its affiliates, they wrote. Goldman Sachs, for one, is named in the creditor matrix but doesn't appear to be a creditor. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, the bank said it had not filed a claim against FTX. ""This type of creditor matrix is prepared by the debtors for the purpose of providing notice to interested parties in a bankruptcy proceeding and is not necessarily evidence of a creditor relationship,"" a spokesperson said. The document doesn't disclose the amount or nature of the debt, and names of individual creditors — mostly customers who deposited funds on FTX — remain redacted at FTX's request. Inclusion on the creditor list doesn't necessarily mean the parties had an FTX account. FTX is believed to have more than a million creditors, the top 50 of whom are collectively owed more than $3 billion. The crypto platform was once of the most popular crypto exchanges on the planet, fueled by celebrity endorsements and high-profile partnerships with sports teams. It marketed itself as a beginner-friendly crypto platform, allowing customers to deposit fiat currency and trade it for digital assets. But FTX came unraveled in November as speculation about its balance sheet sparked investor panic. In the midst of a liquidity crisis, the company filed for bankruptcy, leaving customers in limbo. Federal prosecutors investigating FTX say that its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, orchestrated a massive fraud by stealing customer funds to cover losses at his hedge fund, Alameda Research. They also accuse him of using stolen money to buy luxury real estate and contribute to US poltical campaigns. Bankman-Fried, who was indicted in December and remains under house arrest at his parents' California home, pleaded not guilty to eight criminal counts earlier this month. He has repeatedly denied committing fraud, and is scheduled to go to trial in October. Two of his former business partners have pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges and are cooperating with prosecutors from the Southern District of New York. Both associates have implicated Bankman-Fried in the alleged crimes."
GOP-led states sue Biden administration to block ESG investment rule,"Jan 28, 2023","A coalition of Republican-led states is suing the US Labor Department to block an imminent rule change that will allow 401(k) managers to consider climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when selecting investments. The coalition, led by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, argues the Labor Department rule violates federal law, would put trillions of dollars of retirement savings at risk and is being driven by political ideology. The lawsuit was filed by 25 states, almost all of them led by a Republican governor. The two states led by Democrats, Kentucky and Louisiana, have Republican attorneys general. The final rule, announced in November, is scheduled to take effect on January 30. The rule was aimed at removing restrictions imposed by the Trump administration by clarifying that retirement account managers can consider climate change and ESG factors when they select investments and exercise shareholder rights such as proxy voting. ""The Biden administration is promoting its climate change agenda by putting everyday people's retirement money at risk,"" Reyes said in a statement on Thursday. ""We are acting with urgency on this case because this illegal rule is set to take effect next week. It must be stopped."" The complaint alleges that the Labor Department ESG rule would ""make it easier for fiduciaries to act with mixed motives"" and ""harder for beneficiaries to police such conduct."" The Labor Department referred questions on the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not respond to a request for comment. The 25 states in the lawsuit are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming."
Stocks rise after America's economy grew more than expected,"Jan 27, 2023","President Joe Biden on Thursday trumpeted the latest GDP report that showed the US economy expanded by an annualized 2.9% during the fourth quarter, capping off a year that saw 2.1% economic growth, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday morning. Biden was in Springfield, Virginia, to deliver his first major economic speech of the year.  ""Last summer, plenty of Wall Street analysts were saying that by the end of the year there would be a recession,"" he said. ""They've been telling me since I got elected, we were going to be in a recession. Every time we've gotten better. It turns out, thank God, they were wrong."" Biden also touted the strong labor market, historically low unemployment rate and the declines in inflation during recent months. US stocks were up Thursday, after the government reported that the economy grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than economists were anticipating. It was the fifth consecutive day of gains for the Dow. That data, coupled with a drop in the number of people filing for weekly unemployment benefits and strong durable goods orders from businesses, helped fuel market expectations that the economy may avoid a recession this year. The market is also betting that if inflation continues to cool, the Federal Reserve could hit the pause button on interest rate hikes sometime later this year, a development that would likely increase the chances of an economic soft landing. Shares of Chevron (CVX) rose nearly 5% after announcing a huge stock buyback program and increase to its dividend...news that irked the White House given the high price of oil. BuzzFeed's stock (BZFD) soared, more than doubling after the digital media company announced plans to use artificial intelligence technology to generate content. The Dow rose more than 200 points, or 0.6%. The S&P 500 was up 1.1%. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. The end could be near for struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond warned in a regulatory filing Thursday that it received a notice of default from its lender, JPMorgan Chase. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) plunged more than 20% on the news, to about $2.56 a share. According to the Securities & Exchange Commission filing, Bed Bath & Beyond defaulted ""on or around"" January 13. As a result, creditors are demanding immediate payment. Bed Bath & Beyond could be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization due to its financial woes. The company said in its SEC filing Thursday that ""at this time, the Company does not have sufficient resources to repay the amounts under the Credit Facilities and this will lead the Company to consider all strategic alternatives, including restructuring its debt under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code."" Bed Bath & Beyond added that it is also cutting costs, lowering capital expenditures and closing stores and distribution centers. Investors continued to cheer good news about the economy. All three major market indexes were higher around lunch time. Chevron (CVX) led the Dow following the news of its huge stock buyback plan and dividend increase. Tech giants Salseforce (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were also among the Dow winners. The Dow inched up about 40 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%. Interest rates have soared. The housing market has weakened. Retail sales tumbled during the holidays. But the head of credit card giant Mastercard isn't too worried. ""While macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient,"" said Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach in the company's earnings release Thursday. Miebach added on a conference call with analysts that consumer ""spending patterns have largely normalized relative to the effects of the pandemic with the notable exception of China."" Shares of Mastercard (MA) fell about 2% in midday trading though. The company's outlook is a little more sanguine. Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said on the conference call with analysts that the ""vast majority"" of its markets ""are kind of growing and growing at a healthy pace, but they're not growing at an accelerating pace.""  Credit card rivals Visa (V), American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS) all fell slightly Thursday too. So did the stock of Synchrony (SYF), which reported earnings earlier this week and noted that it expected a ""mild recession"" and rising unemployment rate. Chevron was the top-performing Dow stock of 2022, surging more than 50% thanks to a spike in crude oil prices. Now, Chevron is looking to further reward its shareholders...but it is not making any friends in Washington as a result. Chevron announced a $75 billion share repurchase program late Wednesday. When companies use cash to buy their own stock, it reduces the overall number of shares outstanding and typically leads to an increase in earnings per share as a result. Chevron also boosted its quarterly dividend to shareholders, raising it 6% to $1.51 a share. Shares of Chevron (CVX) rose nearly 4% on the news Thursday. Companies often tout dividends and buybacks as prudent uses of cash. But many in Washington are annoyed by the fact that oil giants haven't taken more steps to use their windfall profits to give workers even bigger pay increases or invest in drilling capacity in order to pump more crude to increase supply and meet demand. White House Assistant Press Secretary Abdullah Hasan took note, tweeting that ""for a company that claimed not too long ago that it was ‘working hard’ to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it."" The US economy continues to grow, but small businesses aren't all reaping the rewards of this expansion. That could be bad news if/when there actually is a recession. According to data from Torsten Slok, chief economist with Apollo Global Management, about 40% of companies in the Russell 2000 index (which looks at small cap stocks) were unprofitable over the past year. To put that into context, only about 15% of the companies reported losses over the previous 12 months during the late 1990s...just before the 2001 recession, after the dot-com bubble imploded. The percentage of companies posting losses spiked in 2001. It did so again during the Great Recession of 2008 and the brief Covid-induced recession of 2020. Slok is concerned that even more small companies will start to bleed red ink if the economy enters another downturn. ""During recessions, the share of unprofitable firms rises. This is not surprising,"" Slok wrote, adding that if this trend continues, more than half of the companies in the Russell 2000 could wind up losing money. If you look at all the data that came out Thursday morning, it's tempting to come to the conclusion that the US economy is still in pretty good shape. Not so fast, says one market expert. Raheel Siddiqui, senior investment strategist at Neuberger Berman, said he thinks investors have to dig deeper in the GDP report. ""I live in the world of data,"" Siddiqui said. ""Today's data was terrible, but most won't tell you that."" Real disposable personal income, for example, fell more than 2% in the fourth quarter from a year ago. That's a sign of how inflation is impacting consumer spending. Siddiqui thinks inflation continues to be a problem for the economy... and that the Fed is going to act accordingly to tame it. He believes there is a greater chance of more aggressive rate hikes than the market is willing to admit. Traders are currently expecting a small rate hike next week... a quarter point. But Siddiqui said a half point isn't out of the question. ""The Fed is hoping that if they continue to raise rates, it will create a negative wealth effect. Spending slows and stocks come down,"" he said. ""The Fed is not winning this game, so I would not be surprised if the Fed does a 50 basis point [half-point] hike to make the market take them seriously,"" he added. ""If I were [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell, it's something I would consider."" US stocks rose after the opening bell as investors treated good economic news as good news for the markets. The nation's economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.9% in the fourth quarter, surpassing consensus forecasts. What's more, the number of Americans filing for weekly jobless claims continued to fall and durable goods orders rose more than expected. In corporate news, shares of Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) surged nearly 10% thanks to strong sales and earnings. Software giants IBM (IBM) and SAP (SAP) both fell in early trading. The two tech companies are the latest to announce layoffs. The Dow gained about 100 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 was up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1%. The economy grew at a slightly faster pace than expected in the fourth quarter. And jobless claims continued to fall. What's more, durable goods orders surged. But Wall Street didn't blink much. Futures were pointing to a somewhat flat to decent gains for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq before the economic data deluge. And they were still mostly unchanged afterwards. It could be that investors realize that this data is backwards looking and is unlikely to change the minds of policy makers on the Federal Reserve all that much. A quarter-point rate hike next week is still the most likely scenario. But investors are still not sure what the Fed will do next? Market bulls are hoping the central bank will pause...and possibly even begin to cut rates later this year if the economy slows. Still, there is no evidence of a severe slump just yet, particularly since the jobs data remains so strong. That's why some investors are even predicting a so-called soft landing, in which the economy slows but does not enter a recession. First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell for the second week in a row to 186,000 for the week ending January 26, according to Department of Labor data released Thursday. That's a decrease of 6,000 from the previous week's revised level of 192,000. The data comes just days ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting to determine whether the central bank needs to continue to raise interest rates aggressively in order to cool the economy. The Fed has been hoping for a softening in the labor market, but the steady level of initial claims, which are considered a proxy for layoffs, continue to show that the labor market remains tight. Initial weekly claims are now at their lowest level since April 2022. The US economy expanded again during the fourth quarter, registering solid growth even as consumers and businesses battled inflation and historically high interest rates. Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — increased at an annualized rate of 2.9% from October to December last year, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. That's a slowdown since summer, when the economy saw growth of 3.2% in the third quarter — but an improvement on the first half of the year, which showed two consecutive quarters of contraction. Economists were expecting fourth-quarter GDP to grow at an annualized adjusted rate of 2.6%. For 2022, GDP expanded 2.1%, according to the Commerce Department report. Read more American Airlines, JetBlue and Alaska Air all reported profitable fourth quarters, although JetBlue and Alaska disappointed investors. JetBlue reported earnings per share of 22 cents, a bit better than the 20 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. But it also warned it expects a loss of between 35 cents to 45 cents a share, far worse than the forecast of a 4 cent a share loss. JetBlue also was the first US airline to report a full-year loss. While most airlines enjoyed a return to profitability due to a strong rebound in demand and fares across the industry, JetBlue reported losses in the first half of the year as it wage a bidding war for Spirit Airlines. American Airlines, which had given bullish guidance for the quarter earlier this month, exceeded the raised expectations, earning $1.17 a share, 3 cents better than forecast and enough to give it a profit for the year. Alaska Air reported EPS of 92 cents, 2 cents less than forecasts. Shares of Alaska were narrowly lower in pre-market trading on the miss, while JetBlue was off 1% on its guidance. American shares were up 1% All airlines had reported losses a year earlier as the surge in Covid cases at that time depressed demand for travel. Those losses continued in the first quarter of 2022. But the industry has been broadly profitable since then, although Southwest reported a large fourth quarter loss earlier Thursday on its December service meltdown. Southwest Airlines reported a loss for the fourth quarter because of the company’s service meltdown over the holiday travel season, and it warned the costs from those problems will result in another loss in the first quarter. The airline was forced to cancel more than 16,700 flights between December 21 and 29, roughly half its schedule during that period. It had already announced that would cost it somewhere between $725 million and $825 miilion. Thursday, Southwest said that resulted in an adjusted net loss in the quarter of $226 million. Still it managed to report an adjusted annual profit of $723 million, a turn around from $1.3 billion it lost in 2021. It said it expects another loss in the first quarter due to the continued impact and costs associated with meltdown. The first quarter is typically the slowest and least profitable period for US air travel. However, Southwest said it is encouraged by strong bookings for March. Read more Investors were gearing up for the first reading of fourth-quarter GDP. Economists are expecting the economy grew by 2.6% on an annualized basis in the final quarter of 2022, which would be down from the third quarter's 3.2% growth. The slowdown is partly due to shoppers pulling back amid higher interest rates, and exports falling as consumers shifted their spending from goods to services.  Stocks: US stocks were mixed ahead of a big day of major economic reports, including the first look at fourth-quarter GDP. Dow futures were down 15 points. S&P 500 futures rose 0.2%. Nasdaq Composite futures were 0.5% higher. Fear & Greed Index: 64 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices rose 0.9% to $81 barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.50 a gallon. A full-blown debt ceiling crisis has the potential to stop the US economy in its tracks, according to the top economist at Goldman Sachs. “If there were any doubt about the US government’s ability or willingness to make interest and principal payments on time, that could have very, very adverse consequences,” Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told CNN in an interview. The United States hit the debt ceiling last week, forcing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to make accounting maneuvers to avoid breaching that $31 trillion borrowing limit. If Congress fails to lift the debt ceiling in time, Hatzius said investors will worry there is a chance of a missed payment on US Treasuries – which are “maybe the most important asset in the global economy.” Unlike many of its peers on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs is relatively bullish on the US economy, with Hatzius telling CNN that America will likely avoid a recession through the 2024 presidential election. However, a debt ceiling crisis is a key risk to that optimistic outlook. Read more Tesla reported record profits for the fourth quarter and the full year, but its profit margins were tighter due to higher costs, recent price cuts, and sales in the quarter that were weaker than hoped. The leading electric vehicle maker posted adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share in the quarter, up from 85 cents a share a year earlier, and its previous record of $1.07 a share in the first quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast EPS of $1.13. For the full year, the company had adjusted earnings per share of $4.07, up from $2.26 in 2021. But the closely-watched automotive gross margin fell to 25.9% from 27.9% in the third quarter and 30.6% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Read more"
Adani slams US short seller 'attack on India' as stock rout hits $70 billion,"Jan 30, 2023","The Adani Group has accused a US investment firm of launching ""a calculated attack"" on India by publishing a report alleging widespread fraud at the ports-to-power conglomerate. Hindenburg Research released its report on billionaire Gautam Adani's business last week, accusing the group of ""brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades."" It said it had taken a short position in Adani Group companies, meaning it would benefit from a drop in their value. Since the release of Hindenburg's report, Adani's business empire has lost more than $70 billion of its stock market value. The infrastructure tycoon's net worth has also plummeted by some $30 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is still Asia's richest man with a personal fortune worth over $92 billion, which is $10 billion more than fellow Indian entrepreneur Mukesh Ambani. The Adani Group had already denounced the Hindenburg report as ""baseless"" and ""malicious"" in its initial response a few hours after the report's release, and said Thursday that it was considering legal action. It followed that on Sunday with a long and angry rebuttal running to more than 400 pages, in which it called Hindenburg's allegations ""baseless and discredited"" and said the research firm had an ""ulterior motive."" ""This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg, an admitted short seller, to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors,"" it said. Fast expansion The 60-year-old tycoon founded the Adani Group over 30 years ago, and is seen as a close ally of India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi. Before the rout, which continued on the Mumbai stock exchange on Monday, markets had been cheering for the businessman and his breathless pace of expansion. Investors were betting on the self-made industrialist's ability to grow his businesses in sectors that Modi had prioritized for development. In its detailed response Sunday, the Adani Group portrayed the US short seller's report as an ""attack"" on India, its economy and investors. ""This is not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India,"" it said. Hidenburg had concluded its report last week with 88 questions for the Adani Group. These ranged from asking for details on the group's offshore entities, to why it has ""such a convoluted, interlinked corporate structure."" The Indian conglomerate called those questions ""rhetorical innuendos coloring rumors as fact."" It then sought to answer them, and published some tables and charts to support its position. The long rebuttal sought to reassure investors about the group's debt, banking relationships and corporate governance practices. Shares in Adani Enterprises, the group's flagship company, were up over 4% on Monday, but most Adani stocks extended last week's losses. Hiding behind 'nationalism'? The conglomerate's chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh compared the Indian market reaction to one of the most horrific events from the country's colonial past under British rule. ""In Jallianwala Bagh, only one Englishman gave an order, and Indians fired on other Indians. So am I surprised by the behavior of some fellow Indians? No,"" Singh told Mint business daily in an interview published Monday. On April 13, 1919, British Brigadier General Reginald Dyer ordered his soldiers to fire without warning on a peaceful protest of thousands of unarmed people in Jallianwala Bagh, a public garden in the city of Amritsar. They stopped firing 10 minutes later when their ammunition ran out. The horrific event is now known as the Jallianwala Bagh or Amritsar Massacre. Hindenburg's claims come at a sensitive time for Adani. He is aiming to raise 200 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) by issuing new shares in Adani Enterprises this month. The offer will close on Tuesday. Hindenburg responded to Adani's rebuttal by saying ""fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism."" ""Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its Chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself,"" it said in a post on Twitter on Sunday. Hindenburg went on to add that the group has ignored ""every key allegation we raised."" ""In terms of substance, Adani's 413 page response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to our report,"" it said. ""The remainder of the response consisted of 330 pages of court records, along with 53 pages of high-level financials, general information, and details on irrelevant corporate initiatives, such as how it encourages female entrepreneurship and the production of safe vegetables."""
FAA promises changes to prevent repeat of air travel safety system collapse,"Jan 31, 2023","The Federal Aviation Administration plans to dramatically accelerate replacing the safety system whose failure led to a nationwide air travel grounding earlier this month. The regulator also said it has taken steps to prevent a repeat of the meltdown in the interim. The FAA outlined the new timeframe and procedures in a letter to Congress Monday. The 30-year-old NOTAM, or Notice to Air Missions, system provides potential flight hazard information to pilots and air traffic controllers. Under previous plans the FAA would have taken at least six years to replace it. But now the system will be replaced by ""mid-2025,"" the FAA said in the letter. The FAA said it now requires ""at least two individuals to be present during the maintenance"" of the NOTAM system. One of the individuals must be a FAA manager, the letter says. CNN first reported the failure was due to a corrupt file in the system. The FAA later confirmed that problem. It said a contract employee unintentionally deleted a file from the database. In the future, changes to the NOTAM system will not be immediately synchronized to the backup system, which ""will prevent data errors from immediately reaching that backup database,"" the letter said. CNN previously reported the issue was discovered on both the main system and a backup system, complicating the recovery. ""Contractor personnel directly involved in the deletion no longer have access to FAA buildings and systems while we complete our investigation,"" the agency wrote. NOTAM is not the only FAA computer system that needs to be upgraded, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told Reuters in an interview Monday. The Biden administration will seek funding to improve air travel computer systems beyond NOTAM, he added, because of the need to ""pick up the pace"" of modernization. ""The broader context is aging systems and growing demand,"" Buttigieg said. ""I don't want this to be 'whack-a-mole' where we figured out one flavor of problem on one system ... only to face another one later on."" The agency reiterated that the ongoing investigation has found ""no evidence of a cyber-attack."" The NOTAM system is separate from the air traffic control system that keeps planes a safe distance from each other. Still, it's another critical tool for air safety. Its messages could include information about a runway lighting outage, nearby construction or unusual flight activity for an air show. ""It's like telling a trucker that a road is closed up ahead. It's critical information,"" said Mike Boyd, aviation consultant at Boyd Group International. But the NOTAM system has problems beyond those that caused the failure. The system's notices are not as efficient and useful as they should be, according to Kathleen Bangs, a former airline pilot and aviation expert. ""It's a clumsy system that often over-burdens pilots with pages and pages of less-than-urgent notices, written in archaic code that sometimes buries that one, critical piece of safety information a pilot really needs."" The incident on January 11 caused more than 9,500 flight delays and 1,300 cancellations, according to data from the tracking service FlightAware. It was the first nationwide grounding of the nation's air traffic system in 20 years, since the days following the September 11 attacks."
Southwest Airlines is testing a software fix it developed after the Christmas travel meltdown,"Jan 27, 2023","Southwest Airlines said it is testing software fixes that the company developed after its Christmas travel meltdown, as the airline faces multiple federal investigations. The software fixes are an ""upgrade,"" rather than a replacement of the crew scheduling system, Southwest executives said on a conference call with reporters Thursday. The airline and its employees have said the scheduling software left the company unable to recover from winter storms on some of the busiest travel days of the year and caused it to cancel more than 16,700 flights between December 21 and 29, roughly half its schedule during that period. The company decided to keep the underlying software system because it ""generally worked as designed"" even during the meltdown, CEO Bob Jordan said. The software's shortcoming, he said, is ""solving past problems."" The company is currently testing the software and expects to begin using it ""in a few weeks' time."" Southwest's cancellations dwarfed other airlines during the Christmas storm because crew members had to call in to the airline, rather than notify the company electronically, to let them know of their availability. ""That was a problem,"" said Andrew Watterston, Southwest's chief operating officer Thursday. ""It wasn't the problem for the situation. It was a symptom of the problem."" Switching to electronic notification would require a change in the labor contracts with pilots and flight attendants, said Jordan. Negotiations are now taking place on replacing the existing contracts covering all issues, including pay and benefits. Other changes stemming from the company's review of its winter meltdown include a new team in its command center, telephone system improvements, and better preparedness for bitterly cold weather. ""We're looking at de-icing procedures top to bottom, we're buying more engine covers for extremely cold weather, we're looking at fuel mixes for ground equipment when you have sub-zero temperatures,"" Jordan said. The company said it doesn't have a cost estimate for the fix. ""We haven't even talked cost, so I don't know if it's going to cost us anything or not,"" said Southwest Chief Operations Officer Andrew Watterson. Investigations The airline's executives also pushed back on the Department of Transportation's announcement late Wednesday that it is investigating whether Southwest ""engaged in unrealistic scheduling of flights"" by selling more tickets than it could handle. If that were the case, ""then you'd expect to see poor on time performance, poor reliability"" even on good weather days, Watterson told reporters on a conference call Thursday. ""You don't see the signs of a schedule that is out of whack with the resources' ability to operate, given our strong operating performance over the last three months,"" Watterson said. In addition to the DOT investigation, the ongoing reviews include an internal probe, one led by its board of directors, and an external inquiry conducted by a consultancy firm. That external report should be delivered in the coming weeks and ""we will attack it with a sense of urgency,"" Jordan said. -- CNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report"
Renault will slash stake in Nissan as they overhaul their alliance,"Jan 30, 2023","Carmakers Renault and Nissan have agreed to restructure their longstanding partnership, with the French company whittling down its stake in the Japanese firm to 15%. Under the agreement, Renault will transfer 28.4% of its shares in the Yokohama-based company into a French trust. Voting rights for that stake will be ""neutralized"" for most decisions, Nissan said in a statement, although Renault will continue to reap the financial benefits from the shares unless they are sold. Renault and Nissan will each retain a 15% stake in one another's businesses through a cross-shareholding agreement, with voting rights. Previously, Nissan had held a 15% non-voting stake in the French company, while Renault owned about 43% of Nissan. The move marks a significant milestone in the 24-year-old auto alliance. Since 1999, both carmakers have worked in tandem, alongside junior partner Mitsubishi Motors. The collaboration has typically allowed the companies to share production and technology, and ultimately save billions of dollars a year. But the group's future was thrown into question in recent years, particularly after the stunning downfall of its former chief Carlos Ghosn in 2018. Ghosn, who had brought the three automakers together, was arrested in Japan, where prosecutors accused him of financial crimes. He fled Japan in 2019, saying he believed he would not have been given a fair trial. He has maintained his innocence and is currently in Lebanon, where he remains a fugitive. France, where he holds citizenship, issued an arrest warrant for him last spring. The scandal prompted speculation that the alliance would be broken up. But in 2020, the companies dismissed such chatter. More recently, Renault and Nissan disclosed that they were rethinking the nature of their relationship. Last October, both companies said that they were ""engaged in trustful discussions"" about the future of the alliance. In its Monday statement, Nissan said the two would continue to work together on projects in Europe, India and Latin America. The Japanese automaker will also invest in Ampere, Renault's recently formed electric vehicle and software business, it added."
"New year, new voters in Fed policymaking","Jan 31, 2023","Every year the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee — aka the officials who decide interest rate moves — gets a slight refresh, with four of the district presidents rotating out as official voting members and four rotating in. The 2023 rotation brings a more dovish-leaning flock, and it comes during a critical year for the US central bank and the American economy. This year the Federal Open Market Committee's new voting members include the newest district president Austan Goolsbee, head of the Chicago Fed; Patrick Harker, of the Philadelphia Fed; Lorie Logan, the Dallas Fed president who started in August 2022; and Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed. Rotating out as voting members are James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed; Susan Collins of the Boston Fed; Esther George, the Kansas City Fed chief who's also retiring this month; and Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed. On the whole the FOMC contingent remains largely similar, with eight of the 12 voting members continuing from 2022. The non-voting members still lend their voices and perspectives to the proceedings. Following a stretch of seven consecutive heavy-handed interest rate hikes last year to battle rising prices, the Fed this year is expected to take a more delicate approach to its blunt monetary policy tools by downshifting on rate increases to an eventual idle. Doves and hawks For new Fed members, be they governors or district presidents, it can take a while to stake out their territory and potentially differ from consensus, said Ellen Meade, a Duke University economics professor who had a 25-year career at the Fed. History has shown that the Reserve bank presidents typically tend to dissent more than board members; however, even that is a small percentage — about 7% — of votes cast, she added. ""I'm not expecting that we will see a lot of dissent in terms of votes,"" she said. ""I think where we might see it is how they color the data that they're seeing."" ""Hawks"" and ""doves"" are commonly used terms to describe Fed members' differing monetary policy approaches. Doves tend to favor looser monetary policy and issues like low unemployment over low inflation. Hawks, however, favor robust rate hikes and keeping inflation low above all else. ""If I had to qualify them as the hawkish- or dovish-leaning, I would say that last year's constellation was a reasonably hawkish one, and this year's constellation is almost certainly not quite as hawkish,"" Meade said. That could change, however, if Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard leaves to head President Joe Biden's economic council. Brainard has been considered as leaning more dovish than Powell and others, so her departure could result in a more hawkish shift in ideology at the top of the Fed. This particular Fed is obviously not quite as well known, Meade noted, adding that ""because we have some new policymakers voting in 2023, we don't have as much information on their policy inclinations as we did for last year's voters."" For any potential split to occur would take some large moves in labor market outcomes -- something not seen to this point, Meade said. ""If [moderating inflation] holds up and the labor market softens but doesn't take a very negative turn, then I think consensus is with us,"" she said. ""I think the question is what happens if the labor market starts to turn quickly?"" The Fed has indicated, through its economic projections, that it would tolerate unemployment rising to the 4.5% to 4.75% range. But if that grows closer or past 5% and inflation hasn't moderated as much as desired, ""then I think we're in a place where we're going to see more signs of disagreement."" As it stands now, Fed officials have largely been singing from the same songbook, said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and founder of Sahm Consulting. ""Whether it was voting members or non-voting members, you didn't see a lot of pushback in public,"" she said. ""There was really a unified force of 'we're going to go big, and we're going to go fast.'"" That unified messaging continued during recent speeches on how the Fed would slow it down, be patient and stay the course, Sahm added. ""The Fed is being very clear across the board, even people you would think of as more 'dovish,' that they do not want to let up too soon and get us into a situation where then they have to come back and do even more,"" she said. ""I don't think that switching up who's voting will matter much."" ""They're all hawks now,"" Sahm added. The Fed also does not want to be in a position where it is lulled into a false sense of security by positive inflation data, she added. Fed Governor Christopher Waller put it bluntly in a speech last week: ""We do not want to be head-faked."" ""It's going to take months and months of good news, and frankly, we're in store for a bumpy ride this year,"" Sahm said. ""It's not like every month is going to be good news on inflation.""

Bed Bath & Beyond says it can no longer pay its debts,"Jan 27, 2023","The end could be near for struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, as it warned in a regulatory filing Thursday that it received a notice of default from its lender, JPMorgan Chase. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) plunged more than 20% on the news, to about $2.56 a share. The company said in its SEC filing Thursday that ""at this time, the Company does not have sufficient resources to repay the amounts under the Credit Facilities and this will lead the Company to consider all strategic alternatives, including restructuring its debt under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code."" Bed Bath & Beyond defaulted ""on or around"" January 13, according to the Securities & Exchange Commission filing. As a result, creditors are demanding immediate payment. Bed Bath & Beyond could be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization due to its financial woes. The company added that it is also cutting costs, lowering capital expenditures and closing stores and distribution centers. Founded in 1971, Bed Bath & Beyond became a staple for affordable home decor, kitchenware and college dorm room furniture. The retailer became known for its ubiquitous 20% off blue coupons, and cavernous stores with merchandise stacked high to the ceilings. But the company struggled to make the transition to online shopping and fend off larger chains such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). Many shoppers switched to those competitors as the novelty of Bed Bath & Beyond's coupons faded -- consumers can find plenty of cheaper alternatives on Amazon (AMZN) and other online sites. The company was also hit hard during the pandemic, closing stores temporarily during 2020 while rivals remained open. The company lost 17% of its sales in 2020 and 14% in 2021. Bed Bath & Beyond has rotated through several different executives and turnaround strategies in recent years, including former Target executive Mark Tritton, who left the company last year after less than three years as CEO. As of February 2022, Bed Bath & Beyond had 950 stores and 32,000 workers. The company also owns children's retailer buybuy Baby."
ASML says 'rules are being finalized' on chip export controls to China,"Jan 30, 2023","ASML, a Dutch maker of semiconductor equipment, says ""rules are being finalized"" on export controls, amid reports that the Netherlands and Japan have joined the United States in restricting sales of some computer chip machinery to China. ""It is our understanding that steps have been made towards an agreement between governments which, to our understanding, will be focused on advanced chip manufacturing technology, including but not limited to advanced lithography tools,"" the company told CNN late Friday in response to questions about export controls to China. ""Before it will come into effect it has to be detailed out and implemented into legislation which will take time."" ASML is known for its prowess in making lithography machines, which uses light to print patterns on silicon. The firm says that step is crucial in the mass production of microchips. The company's response came as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times reported over the weekend that the United States had persuaded the Netherlands and Japan to agree to curb exports of certain chipmaking equipment to China, citing anonymous sources. A deal was reached at the White House on Friday, though it was not officially announced, partly due to ""concerns by Japan and Netherlands about potential retaliation by China,"" according to the Journal, which cited a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg reported that the deal ""would extend some export controls the US adopted in October"" to Dutch and Japanese companies, including ASML, Nikon and Tokyo Electron. The Biden administration had banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license. It also restricted the ability of American citizens to provide support for the development or production of chips at certain manufacturing facilities in China. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside US business hours. Nikon and Tokyo Electron declined to comment. On Saturday, Japan's Economy and Trade Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that he would ""refrain from commenting on diplomatic negotiations."" Asked about the three-way talks in Washington, Nishimura said ""we would like to respond appropriately while taking into consideration the regulatory trends in each country."" Growing tensions Because of its dominance in the market, ASML has been cited by experts as a bellwether of the growing rift between China and the West over access to advanced technology. In recent months, the Dutch government has faced pressure from the United States to limit chip-related exports to China, particularly from ASML, according to Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at the Eurasia Group. In its Friday statement, the company said that based on what has been said by government officials and current market conditions, it did not expect any material impact on its financial projections for 2023. But ASML said its knowledge of the new rules was still limited, making it difficult to map out ""the medium and long-term financial, organizational and global industry-wide impact of new export control rules."" ""While these rules are being finalized, ASML will continue to engage with the authorities to inform them about the potential impact of any proposed rule in order to assess the impact on the global semiconductor supply chain,"" it said. It noted that it mainly sold ""mature"" products to China, and its most advanced lithography technology had already been restricted since 2019. Those machines had been prohibited from being sent to China because the Dutch government had ""refused to grant it a license under US pressure,"" Lu previously told CNN. — CNN's Emiko Jozuka contributed to this report."
"Winter heating costs likely won't be as high as feared, but many still need help","Jan 31, 2023","Heating your home this winter likely won't burn quite as big a hole in your wallet as initially forecast. Both the US Energy Information Administration and the National Energy Assistance Directors Association this month lowered their cost estimates for heating with natural gas and oil. That's thanks to a combination of lower energy prices and a milder-than-expected winter. That's the good news. The bad news is that it will still cost way more to keep warm than it did last winter. That's driving a surge in the number of people applying for federal heating assistance — but not everyone will be able to get the help they need, as there's less federal funding to distribute this year. Lower forecasts Home heating this winter will cost an average of $1,162 across all fuel types, according to EIA's January projection of total average costs for the season. That's down $46 from the agency's October forecast. The change, however, varies widely by fuel. Those who heat with natural gas will pay an estimated $828 over the course of the winter, down $103 from the initial forecast. Heating with oil will cost an estimated $2,342 for the season, down $12 from the October forecast. But that's actually a bigger decrease than it seems because the EIA hiked its projection by several hundred dollars in November amid a spike in oil prices that has since receded. Those with electric heat will pay about the same amount, roughly $1,360, while those who heat with propane will pay an estimated $1,727, up $59 from the earlier projection. Still, costs are up across the board compared to last winter — nearly 26% and 14.5% for heating oil and natural gas, respectively, and 10.5% and nearly 9% for electricity and propane, respectively. ""You're still paying more, but not as much more,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""If the warming trend continues, then it will be cheaper because you just don't need to use as much fuel."" Challenges for small businesses and customers alike All the price fluctuations have made for a tough winter for home heating oil delivery companies, which are usually small, multi-generational family businesses. They have had to work with their banks to increase their lines of credit to purchase inventory and with their customers to put them on budget plans so they can better afford deliveries. More people have had to go on budget plans this year, and they are taking longer to pay their bills, said Sean Cota, CEO of the National Energy & Fuels Institute, a trade association for independent oil heat, propane, biofuel and motor fuel dealers and associated companies. ""For the retail industry, it probably was and continues to be the most challenging year in our history,"" Cota said of the ""crazy differences"" in prices each month. ""The only good part has been that it's been warm because of the tight supply — which is also bad for us, right? Because we need to sell stuff to stay in business."" For Jason Bell, the milder winter — plus a move to a rental house that heats with natural gas instead of electricity — has meant that he and his husband, Shane, can save more money to buy their own home. So far, they received a monthly bill of about $130 for electricity and $236 for natural gas. That compares to the roughly $470 monthly budget plan they were on in their old place, which also cost $200 more a month in rent. The savings, as well as the general decline in inflation in recent months, means that Bell can drop one of his two full-time jobs later this year. ""We were hoping that in conjunction with the warmer temperatures and us turning the thermostat down at night that the heating bill would be a lot less,"" said Bell, who is a police officer in a nearby borough and a state dog warden. ""It offers a lot more breathing room."" Despite the estimated dip in costs, many Americans are in need of help. Applications for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program are projected to reach their highest level in more a decade, Wolfe said. Already, it's up by as many as 1.3 million applications, the largest one-year increase since 2009. That's on top of last year's estimated 4.9 million beneficiaries. To help its residents cope with the high heating costs, Maine started sending $450 energy relief payments on Monday. An estimated 880,000 people will receive the assistance, which will be sent to individuals with incomes below $100,000 and couples filing joint returns making twice that. Each spouse will get the $450 payment. In Connecticut, applications have jumped 23% so far this season, which started in September, said Peter Hadler, the state's LIHEAP director. That's on top of a 27% increase over the same period a year ago. He said his staff is hearing from people dealing with multiple financial challenges, including higher prices for energy and food and the elimination of pandemic supplements, such as the enhanced child tax credit and three rounds of stimulus checks. Triple whammy The agency itself is contending with a triple whammy: more applications, higher fuel costs and less federal funding. Last January, it paid around $3.15 a gallon for oil for fuel delivery. Now, it's around $4.10 a gallon, though at least that's down from the roughly $5.70 a gallon in November. Hadler expects to receive $118.5 million in federal LIHEAP funds for fiscal year 2023, down from $140.5 million the prior fiscal year, when Congress poured billions more into the federal program through the American Rescue Plan Act. Last season, the federal appropriation for LIHEAP totaled a record of about $8.4 billion, while this fiscal year, it's about $6.1 billion. If the federal funds run out, the state has promised to pitch in $30 million. Still, Connecticut has had to reduce the amount of assistance it can grant each household. For instance, last year the lowest-income vulnerable families — who had senior citizens, young children or disabled members — could receive up to $4,825 in fuel deliveries. This season, they can get only a maximum of $2,320. ""We're hearing from seniors and other applicants concerned about their ability to heat their homes,"" Hadler said. ""They're keenly aware of the decline in benefits compared to last year. It's small comfort for them to know that it is due to less federal funding. The bottom line is the benefits are smaller."""
Trader Joe's asked customers to rank their nine top products. Here they are,"Jan 30, 2023","Trader Joe's asked its customers a simple question: If you were to spend the rest of your life on a deserted island, which nine Trader Joe's products would you take with you? More than 18,000 customers responded to its 14th annual survey ranking the grocery store's most popular items in nine different categories. There were some caveats this year: Gone from the running were five products that have won many times in the past (think Mandarin Orange Chicken and dark chocolate peanut butter cups), and instead are featured in its Product Hall of Fame. The first Trader Joe's opened in Pasadena, California, in 1967. Its founder Joe Coulombe (yes, Joe was a real guy), was a convenience store owner who wanted to open a grocery chain to appeal to a niche market of well-educated, well-traveled consumers. The idea led him to create a cult-favorite grocery empire. Here are the products customers voted their favorites, in categories from cheese to entrees. Top Overall Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Tortilla Chips, spicy corn chips, swept the competition this year, taking home the top prize. Runners-up included the hash browns, chicken soup dumplings, Everything but the Bagel sesame seasoning blend, and chocolate croissants. See the all-time favorites included in Trader Joe's Hall of Fame The chips also won in the poll's favorite snack category. Customers were also fans of the Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers, Organic Corn Chip Dippers, World's Puffiest White Cheddar Corn Puffs and Crunchy Curls, which were all among the top vote-getters. Top Beverage The Sparkling Honeycrisp Apple Juice was the fans' favorite beverage, though it is seasonal. The canned drink is a simple three-ingredient blend of apple juice, water and bubbles. Following is the Triple Ginger Brew, Sparkling Peach Black Tea with peach juice, Sparkling Cranberry & Ginger Beverage and the Non-Dairy Brown Sugar Oat Creamer. Top Cheese Now that Hall of Famer Unexpected Cheddar is no longer an option in the poll, the store's cheddar cheese with caramelized onions took home top accolades. See the full list of customer choice award winners Runners-up included Syrah Soaked Toscano, seasonal Baked Lemon Ricotta, Blueberry & Vanilla Chèvre and its various bries. Top Entree Replacing the longtime Mandarin Orange Chicken is Trader Joe's Butter Chicken -- spiced chicken in a tomato and cream sauce with basmati rice. Indian is popular with Trader Joe's customers. Second runner-up was Chicken Tikka Masala, followed by Kung Pao Chicken, Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese and BBQ Teriyaki Chicken. Top Household Item Seasonal candles won out in this category. Its seasonal scents include Peony Blossom, Cedar Balsam, Honeycrisp Apple and Vanilla Pumpkin. Runners-up: Daily Facial Sunscreen, Ultra-Moisturizing Hand Cream, Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo & Conditioner, and Shea Butter & Coconut Oil Hair Mask. Top Produce Unsurprisingly, customers voted bananas as their top choice. The chain is known for its 25-cent organic bananas and 19-cent regular bananas. Following choices were Teeny Tiny Avocados, Honeycrisp Apples, Brussels Sprouts and Organic Carrots of Many Colors. Top Dessert The tiny and crunchy Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones won top dessert, followed by Danish Kringle, Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches, Chocolate Lava Cakes and Brookie. Top vegan/vegetarian Among its many vegan and vegetarian options, the Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto came out on top. Vegetable Fried Rice, Beefless Bulgogi, Palak Paneer, Cauliflower Gnocchi followed."
Ford drops the price of its Tesla competitor,"Jan 31, 2023","Ford is boosting production of its popular Mustang Mach-E electric SUV and dropping its sticker price weeks after Tesla dropped prices of its vehicles. The move represents a substantial roll-back of price hikes Ford announced last summer on the 2023 models -- but buyers may still be paying somewhat more than before the increases. The Mustang Mach-E, a midsize electric family SUV, was the first serious electric effort for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker. Priced and aimed squarely at the Tesla Model Y, which has its own starting price of $53,490, the Mach-E is Ford's bet to get new car buyers to dip their toes into the battery-powered future. it has since been joined in the electric Ford lineup by the workhorse Ford F-150 Lightning. But the company still considers the Mach-E a crucial step for the company's electric-powered growth. Late last year, Darren Palmer, Ford's vice president of electric vehicle programs, told CNN Business that the Mach-E was completely sold out and the automaker was holding off on launching it in more global markets in order to catch up with US demand. ""We could sell it out at least two or three times over,"" he said a the time. The price cuts Ford announced Monday were biggest on the most expensive versions of the SUV, just as the increases had been biggest on those models. The base sticker of the Mustang Mach-E GT Extended Range, a high-performance version of the SUV, dropped to about $64,000 from $69,900 before, a decrease of $5,900. But that model had been about $62,000 before price increases last August. When it announced those price bumps, Ford also said it was putting more standard features into the vehicles, including advanced driver assistance features. The price of the least expensive Mach-E, the rear-wheel-drive standard range model, was cut $900, going from about $46,900 down to $46,000. The price of the extended range battery pack option, by itself, dropped from $8,600 down $7,000. Tesla announced price cuts of as much as 20% on its electric vehicles earlier this month, after raising prices in 2022. When Ford announced the price increases last summer, citing supply chain issues, the automakers indicated it would continue monitoring market conditions throughout the upcoming model year. Ford announced last summer that it was increasing production of the Mach-E as it added capacity for more battery production. The automaker also announced in late August that it was reopening order banks for the Mach-E which had been closed as the company worked to meet existing orders. Customers who complete the transaction for their Mach-E after today's announcement will pay the new lower price, Ford said. Ford will reach out directly to Mach-E customers with a sale date after January 1, 2023 who already have their vehicles, the automaker said. At least some versions of both models are currently eligible for federal electric vehicle tax credits, according to the Internal Revenue Service, but both are treated as cars, not SUVs, under the tax rules, unless equipped with a third row of seats. That means that tax credits are available for the two-row only Mach-E and two-row Model Y only if the sticker price is below $55,000. For versions of the Model Y with a third row of seats, a $4,000 option, buyers may get tax credits with a sticker price up to $80,000. For the Mustang Mach-E, a third row of seats isn't offered. The final amount of the tax credit may depend on when the vehicle is actually delivered to the customer and, also, whether the customers themselves meet annual income requirements."
